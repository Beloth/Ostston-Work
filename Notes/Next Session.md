## Next Session

### Enterance to the vault

* As the party approaches the enterance they can hear sounds of battle from all around the temple. Looking around they will see clashes between the temple guards and presumably the cultist, but its nearly impossible to tell which is which as they are all dressed in temple uniforms. You can hear explosions from the balcony indicating that the Archanist is still fighting.
* The High Priest speaks to one of the rangers, "show these adventures to the vault. I must rally the faithful."  
  * He turns to the party "Good luck. Stop whatever terror they are building too, should we survive this I'll tell you whatever I can remember"  
  * He booms out in a powerful voice. "Devotess of Meilikki! To arms, there are traitors unmongst us! Rally to the Tree of Meilikki!
  
* As the party starts down the enterance to the vault they can see 2 large parties of faithful heading towards the tree...
