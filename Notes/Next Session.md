### Arcahnist Shaneria's Mage Tower

* Stable pocket dimension
* Those who are magically inclined can feel the power, all around pulsing like a heart beat. 
* Yojimbo - You feel your own power rising beating in time. Normally you have to actively bring the power to the surface and shape it to your willing, at times forcing it but now its also most earger, right at your finger tips. 
* Branton and Ogden - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
* Kairon - You feel the power surround you, almost suffercatingly so. It beats around you, You get the strange sensation that its almost alive.. and inspecting you, testing you... you try to call on your own magics in readiness to defend yourself if necessary and reaching for the connection to your patron it responds slowly but then the ambient magic as if sensing it almost leaps at the connection smoothering it. Its still there but weak your not sure what would happen should you try to cast anything.
            

* Thanks you for the rescue of the investigators. 
* The Sages have passed on a reward of 200g 
* They need time to recover and find out what happened to Dalee. 
* They are unsure what the orb did/does but has affected her mind. She has gaps in her memory.
* Someone must have betrayed the investigators. Someone from within the guard? The Council or more worrying the Sages of the Arcane?
* Must continue the investigation especially since this portal, if within the city walls could conceivable bring an army in, bypassing the defenses.
* Going to keep the circle of who knows about the investigation to a minimum. Meaning the party, him and Shaniera.
