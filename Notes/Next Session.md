## Highcastle
      
The large central keep dominates the skyline as you approach Highcastle. It is surrounded by tall walls and several towers making it a formidable defensive structure. Its defensive position however has been slightly compromised by the sprawling town that has sprung up around it, giving any attacker cover to approach the walls. At attempt to build a stone wall around the town has been started but currently only consists of a single gate keep and several hundred feet of wall

### Reception in Highcastle
* If you present the wooden token a guard leads you to a room in the keep which has a guarded closed door.
  * "Wait here" and he heads to the closed door, knocks then enters. The door is left slightly ajar
  * Perception check to listen in:
    * 10+ raised voices but can't make out all the words. Merchants, upset. Not enough men. Patrols East.
    * 15+ The Merchants areupset. They have been complaining about the amount of crime in the city. We need to setup up the amount of patrols in the city. We don't have enough men to patrol the city and send patrols East. Both Hillard and Pallen have report then all clear so there is no need to send patrols out.
  * With that the door swings open and out strides a relatively small man.
    * 5'4"-5'5"
    * Late 40's
    * Balding
    * Has a belly on him
