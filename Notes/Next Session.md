### Temple of Mielikki
#### Description of Mielikki

Mielikki (pronounced my-LEE-kee), also referred to as the Forest Queen, was the neutral good goddess of autumn, druids, dryads, forests, forest creatures and rangers. Her symbol was a gold-horned, blue-eyed, unicorn's head facing left 

The members of Mielikkiâ€™s church are widespread and rarely collect into large groups for any length of time. There are few temples to the Forest Queen; most worship takes place in glades or at small shrines. Temples always include a small stand of trees if not actually constructed in a grove. Most have at least one oak, which serves as both altar and the home of a dryad. Small forest creatures are always welcome within such houses of worship, and many reside therein year-round.

* Like a Roman courtyard, building surrounding an open space with a Large Oak tree in the centre. Has a cerimonial altar in front of it
  * Relatively small temple as worshippers tend to be in more wildeness areas and not urban.
  * Guarded by rangers

* Priest/priestess seem friendly enough and will answer some questions but a perception check DC15, glassy eyed. Almost absentminded.

#### High Priest Aimar Cracan
* High Priest Aimar Cracan, Eldarly Male Elf
  * Being controlled by a slave collar.
  * Enventually he will call the guards to attack
    * Temple of Mielikki Encounter - Map1
  * Arcana check to remove the collar
    * `>` 10 - the collar can just be cut off - Both the cutter and the priest take 2d6 lightning damage from the feedback of the runes being destoryed
    * 10 to 15 - Can be cut off but must insulate both the person cutting and the priest. Will take 1d4 if insulated or 2d6 if not. Dispel magic (level 5 or greater)
    * 15+ - Inspecting the runes you spot a weak point that could be used to disable the collar but will take time. 10-20mins. Else see above
    * Crit Success - Spot a shatter point. Tell everyone to look away. Strike at the shatter point and in a flash of light and heat the collar shatters. The priest takes 1 point of fire damage. Or see above
  * After removed must move quickly, they often check that I am still under their control as the collar was not perfect.
  * They made me replace some of the rangers with their own people, but not all
  * Priest was given instructions  
    * Tolded to encourage clergy to go on pilgrimages and reduce number of people at the temple to a minimum
    * The few worshippers that come 
    * Was asked about the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was at the heart of Blackpine forest
  * Information the priest gave them    
    * I was approached by someone impersonating an imperial historian. They wanted information on the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was said to have been built in the centre of Blackpine forest.
    * Blackpine forest info  
      * It was said that a grand temple was built there. A huge place where worshippers of Mielikki would go as a pilgrimage. 
      * It was there that the Heart of Mielikki was stored.
      * There was a corruption. No one knows what type. But the temple was ripped from this plane leaving the lake that is now at the centre of Blackpine.
    * Ostston temple info
      * There was a cave system under the temple that was enlarged and converted during the purging
        * Purging - The time a couple of centuries ago when there was years of drought. The priesthood at the time hoarded food and there were riots against them and their followers.
      * Mainly forgotten now and rarely used
      * Entrance within the roots of the central tree of Meilikki. Pull down the horns of the Unicorn.
* High Priest Aimar Cracan can help get you to the entrance but he is badly injured

#### Hidden Tree Entrance 
Map2

  * 10 to 15 - spot 4 plus a priest
  * 15+ - spot 6 plus priest
* If High Priest there 2 of the rangers will support the group


### Find who is Lord T

There are several Lords with names begining with T. The mostly higly placed is Lord Tanafrey, but there are others. The most suspicious is Lord Terbanis, Alimond Terbanis. He is a relatively recent addition to the Ostston court. His family is rather pominent in Adrana. 

#### Lord Alimond Terbanis

  * Branton make an Int check
    * `>`10 - Terbanis is a powerful family on par with your own. It would be unwise to make accusations without solid proof
    * 10 to 15 - Their powerbase however is around the captial Adrana. They could be trying to grow their infulance eastward. Something your parents would be interested in.
    * 16 to 20 - You remember the name Alimond. He was a notorious rake and gambler, using his family's name to get him out of trouble. In fact just before you left the captial there were rumours of him and the daughter of a Duke....
    
Human male is faint elvish ancestry which can be seen by his slightly pointed ears. Early to mid 20's. Pencil thin moustache and pointed goatee. Expensive clothing and ornate rapier.

He is meant to be in Ostston to make trade agreements but seems more intent on trying to get acquainted with Lady Gellantara. Quiet unseemly really considering she is still in mourning. 

#### Lord Frederick Torine

Late 50's Lord. Greying brown hair. He has been a thorn in the council's side for years, at least politically. He was a close friend of Lord Gellantara but was most put out when Lady Gellantara was name regent upon the Lord's death and has obstructed the council greatly without directly disobeying. Neither the Marshalle or Arcanist can see him involved in something like this.

#### Lord Lional Tanafrey


The childhood sweetheart of a pre-married Lady Gellantara, he was devesated by the marriage between her and Lord Gellantara and much to the chargin of his family left to go adventuring. He became a rather famed fighter adventurer. When his father died he returned to take his place as Lord Tanafrey and a place on the Ostston council. After the death of Lord Gellantara became Lady Gellantara chief advisor.

Currently the advisor to Lady Gellantara, not only because he is a powerful Ostston noble but he was also a childhood friend. In his younger days he was a well known adventurer and still keeps in good shape with regular sparring with his guard. He recently gave use of his guard to the city to help keep the unrest under control

Dark black hair, rich but practical clothing. Stern demenour which softens when speaking with Lady Gellantara.

### Side Quest - The Rice farm

A young man is drowning his sorrows in an inn. He has a small sized sack by his feet. Staring into his empty tankard.

* If the party enquire he will explain that he met a trader would had travelled from a far away land in the far east and that he told tales of a miracle crop that you could grow in swampy grounds. He even had a small amount of seed... he kicks the sack at his feet
* Thinking he could grow this crop in the swamplands to the south he purchased the seed. He even went as far as to buy some of the land off, he had to borrow money to do so, but thought it would be a worthwhile investment. 
* However he was conned. When he went to plant the seed he found that that piece of land was already inhabited... by a Troll. 
* He doesn't have the money to put a bounty on it with the Order of the Anvil and can't get anymore credit.
* Willing to give 5% of the profit if the party will kill the Troll

### Side Quest - The Inn

* Running low of wine
  * Normal supplier is out of wine. 
* Price gouging.
