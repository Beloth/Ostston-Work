### Mausoleum

#### Ostston's burial area 
The cememtary that serves Ostston is about 2 hour walk north east of Ostston. Various private burial areas owned by noble familiies. Those who cannot be buried in the family mausoleums are buried in the cemetary but they are generally the wealthier people who will have headstones. Some will just have place markers. There are also several groves of trees where ashes will often be spread.

##### Statue at the enterance

At the enterance of the mausoleum stands a 10 foot tall statue of Eldath the goddess of peace. Making an offering of more than 50gp or equvialent will grant the blessing of protection (+1 AC) for 1 hour. The offering will disappear.

##### Top level of the mausoleum

Not too much appears to have been disturbed until you get to the tomb that has been moved. Investigation check DC 18. The tomb is hinged. There seems to be a mechanical structure that moves the tomb.

Murdered by the son who wanted to take the reins of the family.

#### The Door
Large double doors with ornate decoration with multiple examples of the family crest (3 stars and a cresent moon) integrated into the pattern. 2 central handles above the key hold.

    * Success - After looking aound you notice that on the opposite side of the door there is a slightly raised stone approximately the mirror of the panel. IF you press it, there is a click and the panel swings open, if you release the button the panel closes again.
    * Faled - The panel is so well fitted that there doesn't seem to be a way of prising it open. 
  * Success - You find that the door is securely barred. Almost as well a castle door. Looking between the gaps above, below and to the sides you can see bars that are holding the door shut.
  * Fail - The door is secuely locked. Obvious there must be a method to unlock it from this side but you can't see it.
  
* If the party takes too long, Thorath pushes passed the party grumbling under his breath. Seems to be cursing the party's lack of ability to sort the simple things out. He get one of them to push down the button telling them not to release it to open the panel.

#### The lock

The panel revels a dark fist sized hole and what appears to be the stump of a hand pushed in....
Removing the hand and peering in revels the locking mechanism. On the hand appears to be a wooden ring which has a large warped wooden protrusion that looks to have been damaged. Thorath pulls out a strange ring that has an oddly shaped large rock on it. He offers it to the party. If the party doesn't accept he will do it but will also take out a chain mail glove to protect his hand.

* Need to push the ring forward into the hole and twist. Which way do you twist?
  * Anti-Clockwise - you hear a grinding of gears turning and the the bars sliding from the door. As the noise stops twisted metal plates emerge from the hole surrounding your hand and trapping it inside. Inspecting the metal you can see blood stains
    * If you twist back the doors will relock.
  * Clockwise - Twisted metal plates emerge from the hole surrounding your hand and trapping it inside. You feel something pierce your hand. Take 1d4 damage. Make a Con saving throw DC15.

#### Temple to find out more about the cursed opal

The Opal is not strictly cursed but is part of a magical item set called "The gems of Sidruis". The opal is the slave gem and provides the master gem's owner the best characteristic of the owner of the slave. They were popular centuries ago with noblility who used them to improve their children and they were originally completely voluntary. However the extreme cost of them caused many shortcuts to be taken leading to the gem the party currently holds were there where no safeguards in place. The clerics go on to describe the 2 possible methods of neutralising the curse. Either find the master gem and used that to remove the link or find someone who who take on the curse.

The temple is willing to try to find someone if that is the route the party wishes to go down. There are often people who are down on their luck willing to go to extreme measures... 250gp

Otherwise... a place to look would be the Granrus's

#### Return to the Order of the Anvil

* Mistress of Contracts Roseanne Lemia will see them. 
  * It would appear that you are successful, any complications? Thorath will give her a report in private  and then a decision will be made. Needs 3 of the leaders of the guild to approve, so return the next day. The reward of 400g will be given.
  
#### Meeting with High Marshal Felarn

* There is "thug" guarding the door. Rather large human male with a large scar running down from his eye across his cheek. Perception check dc 12+
  * Success - The clothing seems rather well nice of a common thug, and the sword scabbard seems remarkably similar to the city guard scabbards.
* He looks the party over before nodding to them and hits the doors with a series of knocks.. after a few seconds a voice comes out.. send them in..

##### Archanist Shaniera

  * Investigator Dalee - Female Elf - Wizard

##### Notes on the table
* Subject is tough. Seems to have had some training in resisting interrogation but people always break. You just need to know their breaking point.
* Unfortunately he doesn't seem to have alot of information that my employee wants. He knew somethings on magical defenses but nothing specific to Ostston's defense. No knowledge of any heartstone, but believed that Shaniera would know if there was any here.
