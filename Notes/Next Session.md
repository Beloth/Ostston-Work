Looks like a representation of Mystra the Goddess of magic (Mystra (pronounced: /ˈmɪstrɑː/ MISS-trah), the Mother of all Magic, was a greater deity and the second incarnation of the goddess of magic, sybol 8 pointed star within a circle).

### Arcahnist Shaneria's Mage Tower

* Stable pocket dimension
* Those who are magically inclined can feel the power, all around pulsing like a heart beat. 
  * Yojimbo - You feel your own power rising, beating in time. Normally you have to actively bring the power to the surface and shape it to your will, at times forcing it but now its also most earger, right at your finger tips like it wants to challenge the power around you.
  * Branton - Tower1 - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
  * Ogden - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
  * Kairon - You feel the power surround you, almost suffercatingly so. It beats around you, You get the strange sensation that its almost alive.. and inspecting you, testing you... you try to call on your own magics in readiness to defend yourself if necessary and reaching for the connection to your patron it responds slowly but then the ambient magic as if sensing it almost leaps at the connection smoothering it. Its still there but weak your not sure what would happen should you try to cast anything.
  * Enaris - Tower1 - Eniaris. Your senses, always attuned to nature reach out but where you normally sense the power of nature you fell nothing... Perturbed you feel inward to your own personal store of power and to your relief its still there.
  * Ahsoka - Your ki rising up in response to the power in the air. You feel it beating just blow the surface of your skin, acting almost like a deffense against the magic.
            
* Thanks you for the rescue of the investigators. 
* The Sages have passed on a reward of 200g 
* They need time to recover and find out what happened to Dalee. 
* They are unsure what the orb did/does but has affected her mind. She has gaps in her memory.
* Someone must have betrayed the investigators. Someone from within the guard? The Council or more worrying the Sages of the Arcane?
* Must continue the investigation especially since this portal, if within the city walls could conceivable bring an army in, bypassing the defenses.
* Going to keep the circle of who knows about the investigation to a minimum. Meaning the party, him and Shaniera.
* Shaniera will make a show of inspecting the city's magical defences but will be using that tour as a way of triangulating where the portal site is.
  * Once they know where the portal site is they will call on you.
* Mean while Marshal Falern will investigate who Lord T is.
  
#### Find the Portal Site
* Shaniera was being followed while she toured the magical defensive sites but no attack made.
* Found that the portal is in a surprising place is in or under the temple to Mielikki (Goddess of forests, forest creatures, rangers, dryads, autumn).
* Need to find out whether the priesthood of Mielikki are involved or its being hidden from them.
* Cannot risk upsetting the religious by having the city guard search or tip their hand.
* Need the party to discretely investigate.

### Temple of Mielikki
#### Description of Mielikki

Mielikki (pronounced my-LEE-kee), also referred to as the Forest Queen, was the neutral good goddess of autumn, druids, dryads, forests, forest creatures and rangers. Her symbol was a gold-horned, blue-eyed, unicorn's head facing left 

The members of Mielikki’s church are widespread and rarely collect into large groups for any length of time. There are few temples to the Forest Queen; most worship takes place in glades or at small shrines. Temples always include a small stand of trees if not actually constructed in a grove. Most have at least one oak, which serves as both altar and the home of a dryad. Small forest creatures are always welcome within such houses of worship, and many reside therein year-round.

* Like a Roman courtyard, building surrounding an open space with a Large Oak tree in the centre. Has a cerimonial altar in front of it
  * Relatively small temple as worshippers tend to be in more wildeness areas and not urban.
  * Guarded by rangers

* Priest/priestess seem friendly enough and will answer some questions but a perception check DC15, glassy eyed. Almost absentminded.

#### High Priest Aimar Cracan
* High Priest Aimar Cracan, Eldarly Male Elf
  * Being controlled by a slave collar.
  * Enventually he will call the guards to attack
    * Temple of Mielikki Encounter - Map1
  * Arcana check to remove the collar
    * `>` 10 - the collar can just be cut off - Both the cutter and the priest take 2d6 lightning damage from the feedback of the runes being destoryed
    * 10 to 15 - Can be cut off but must insulate both the person cutting and the priest. Will take 1d4 if insulated or 2d6 if not. Dispel magic (level 5 or greater)
    * 15+ - Inspecting the runes you spot a weak point that could be used to disable the collar but will take time. 10-20mins. Else see above
    * Crit Success - Spot a shatter point. Tell everyone to look away. Strike at the shatter point and in a flash of light and heat the collar shatters. The priest takes 1 point of fire damage. Or see above
  * After removed must move quickly, they often check that I am still under their control as the collar was not perfect.
  * They made me replace some of the rangers with their own people, but not all
  * Priest was given instructions  
    * Tolded to encourage clergy to go on pilgrimages and reduce number of people at the temple to a minimum
    * The few worshippers that come 
    * Was asked about the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was at the heart of Blackpine forest
  * Information the priest gave them    
    * I was approached by someone impersonating an imperial historian. They wanted information on the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was said to have been built in the centre of Blackpine forest.
    * Blackpine forest info  
      * It was said that a grand temple was built there. A huge place where worshippers of Mielikki would go as a pilgrimage. 
      * It was there that the Heart of Mielikki was stored.
      * There was a corruption. No one knows what type. But the temple was ripped from this plane leaving the lake that is now at the centre of Blackpine.
    * Ostston temple info
      * There was a cave system under the temple that was enlarged and converted during the purging
        * Purging - The time a couple of centuries ago when there was years of drought. The priesthood at the time hoarded food and there were riots against them and their followers.
      * Mainly forgotten now and rarely used
      * Entrance within the roots of the central tree of Meilikki. Pull down the horns of the Unicorn.
* High Priest Aimar Cracan can help get you to the entrance but he is badly injured

#### Hidden Tree Entrance 
Map2
* Several rangers around. 
* No idea whether good or bad.
* Perception check will spot rangers guarding:
  * `>` 10 - spot 2 plus a priest
  * 10 to 15 - spot 4 plus a priest
  * 15+ - spot 6 plus priest
* If High Priest there 2 of the rangers will support the group


### Find who is Lord T

There are several Lords with names begining with T. The mostly higly placed is Lord Tanafrey, but there are others. The most suspicious is Lord Terbanis, Alimond Terbanis. He is a relatively recent addition to the Ostston court. His family is rather pominent in Adrana. 

#### Lord Alimond Terbanis

  * Branton make an Int check
    * `>`10 - Terbanis is a powerful family on par with your own. It would be unwise to make accusations without solid proof
    * 10 to 15 - Their powerbase however is around the captial Adrana. They could be trying to grow their infulance eastward. Something your parents would be interested in.
    * 16 to 20 - You remember the name Alimond. He was a notorious rake and gambler, using his family's name to get him out of trouble. In fact just before you left the captial there were rumours of him and the daughter of a Duke....
    
Human male is faint elvish ancestry which can be seen by his slightly pointed ears. Early to mid 20's. Pencil thin moustache and pointed goatee. Expensive clothing and ornate rapier.

He is meant to be in Ostston to make trade agreements but seems more intent on trying to get acquainted with Lady Gellantara. Quiet unseemly really considering she is still in mourning. 

#### Lord Frederick Torine

Late 50's Lord. Greying brown hair. He has been a thorn in the council's side for years, at least politically. He was a close friend of Lord Gellantara but was most put out when Lady Gellantara was name regent upon the Lord's death and has obstructed the council greatly without directly disobeying. Neither the Marshalle or Arcanist can see him involved in something like this.

#### Lord Lional Tanafrey


The childhood sweetheart of a pre-married Lady Gellantara, he was devesated by the marriage between her and Lord Gellantara and much to the chargin of his family left to go adventuring. He became a rather famed fighter adventurer. When his father died he returned to take his place as Lord Tanafrey and a place on the Ostston council. After the death of Lord Gellantara became Lady Gellantara chief advisor.

Currently the advisor to Lady Gellantara, not only because he is a powerful Ostston noble but he was also a childhood friend. In his younger days he was a well known adventurer and still keeps in good shape with regular sparring with his guard. He recently gave use of his guard to the city to help keep the unrest under control

Dark black hair, rich but practical clothing. Stern demenour which softens when speaking with Lady Gellantara.
