### Ostston
 
* Entering the city from the southern enterance
* Appear to be a queue of people trying to enter the city.
  * By the side of the road there appears to be an area where wagons and carts are diverted in order to be inspected.
    * A rather fat guard sitting at a table scribbing on paper and talking to the owners of the wagons while the other guards search the wagons.
    * Perception check DC15 
      * you notice merchants handing small pouches to the guard and being let through without inspection.
  * People carrying goods (baskets) are also inspected.
    * Whoever is carrying the WWW chest is pointed to this queue, however once they see the WWW symbol you are let through
  * People without any obvious goods are let through
    
* Perception check from those who have grown up in cities
  * Yojimbo, Branton.
  * DC 14
    * There's something not right. People moving quickly around without speaking with each other, eyes down. 
    * Groups af armed people, not the City Guard, "patroling" the streets.
    * Notice a stand off between 2 of the groups which breakup once a patrol of city guard are seen.

    * Temple guards brought in to protect temple land.

### Inn
* Passive perception dc12
  * People are casting distrustful looks at the party.

* 1 Halfing keeps giving the party sneaky looks and scuries out.
  * a few minutes later a group of people enter the inn and after looking around spots the party and heads towards them.
* Large half orc with a heavily scarred face gets in the face of Kairon
  * "You're in my seat devil"
  * "You don't disrespect Krot like that!"
  * Takes a swing at Kairon.

### Major Tharin
* Seek out Major Tharin of the guard
  * He is the 2nd in charge of the guard here in Ostston. Usually found at the Guard Headquarters (9 on map)
  * He will take the "evidence"
  * Has been informed of the death of Lord Greynoot.
  * If the party is convincing enough he will take the evidence to the High Marshal.
    * Please stay in the city so that we can call on you to give evidence to the HIgh Marshal.
    
### Winyfred's Wonderous Wares
* Happy to have the chest back.
  * The party sees her take out a ring hung around her neck. Places it against the chest and turns. The runes glow red briefly before turning blue and then fading. There is a click and the chest opens. She looks inside, nods and closes it again.  
  * Gives a reward of 100gp
