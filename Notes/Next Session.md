      * you notice merchants handing small pouches to the guard and being let through without inspection.
  * People carrying goods (baskets) are also inspected.
    * Whoever is carrying the WWW chest is pointed to this queue, however once they see the WWW symbol you are let through
  * People without any obvious goods are let through
* In the city you notice a lack of the guard, instead there seems to be armed patrols of men bearing the crest of a falcons head.
  * Perception check for those who grew up in a city (Brenton, Yojimbo) DC10
    * Pass - The citizens seems wary of these patrols. More so than you would expect of a city guard.

### Inn

  * People are casting suspicious looks at the parties general location

    * Pass - You notice that an female elf in robes entered with the group but splits had heads towards the fireplace. Once there she turns and faces the group.
* Large half orc with a heavily scarred face gets in the face of Yojimbo

  * Takes a swing at Yojimbo.

  * He will take the "evidence"
  * Has been informed of the death of Lord Greynoot.
  * If the party is convincing enough he will take the evidence to the High Marshal.
    * Please stay in the city so that we can call on you to give evidence to the High Marshal.
    
### Winyfred's Wonderous Wares
* Happy to have the chest back.
  * The party sees her take out a ring hung around her neck. Places it against the chest and turns. The runes glow red briefly before turning blue and then fading. There is a click and the chest opens. She looks inside, nods and closes it again.
