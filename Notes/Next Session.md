### Arcahnist Shaneria's Mage Tower

* Stable pocket dimension
* Those who are magically inclined can feel the power, all around pulsing like a heart beat. 
* Yojimbo - You feel your own power rising beating in time. Normally you have to actively bring the power to the surface and shape it to your willing, at times forcing it but now its also most earger, right at your finger tips. 
* Branton and Ogden - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
* Kairon - You feel the power surround you, almost suffercatingly so. It beats around you, You get the strange sensation that its almost alive.. and inspecting you, testing you... you try to call on your own magics in readiness to defend yourself if necessary and reaching for the connection to your patron it responds slowly but then the ambient magic as if sensing it almost leaps at the connection smoothering it. Its still there but weak your not sure what would happen should you try to cast anything.
            
* Thanks you for the rescue of the investigators. 
* The Sages have passed on a reward of 200g 
* They need time to recover and find out what happened to Dalee. 
* They are unsure what the orb did/does but has affected her mind. She has gaps in her memory.
* Someone must have betrayed the investigators. Someone from within the guard? The Council or more worrying the Sages of the Arcane?
* Must continue the investigation especially since this portal, if within the city walls could conceivable bring an army in, bypassing the defenses.
* Going to keep the circle of who knows about the investigation to a minimum. Meaning the party, him and Shaniera.
* Shaniera will make a show of inspecting the city's magical defences but will be using that tour as a way of triangulating where the portal site is.
  * Once they know where the portal site is they will call on you.
* Mean while Marshal Falern will investigate who Lord T is.
  
#### Find the Portal Site
* Shaniera was being followed while she toured the magical defensive sites but no attack made.
* Found that the portal is in a surprising place is in or under the temple to Mielikki (Goddess of forests, forest creatures, rangers, dryads, autumn).
* Need to find out whether the priesthood of Mielikki are involved or its being hidden from them.
* Cannot risk upsetting the religious by having the city guard search or tip their hand.
* Need the party to discretely investigate.

#### Temple of Mielikki
##### Description of Mielikki

Mielikki (pronounced my-LEE-kee), also referred to as the Forest Queen, was the neutral good goddess of autumn, druids, dryads, forests, forest creatures and rangers. Her symbol was a gold-horned, blue-eyed, unicorn's head facing left 

The members of Mielikkiâ€™s church are widespread and rarely collect into large groups for any length of time. There are few temples to the Forest Queen; most worship takes place in glades or at small shrines. Temples always include a small stand of trees if not actually constructed in a grove. Most have at least one oak, which serves as both altar and the home of a dryad. Small forest creatures are always welcome within such houses of worship, and many reside therein year-round.

* Like a Roman courtyard, building surrounding an open space with a Large Oak tree in the centre. Has a cerimonial altar in front of it
  * Relatively small temple as worshippers tend to be in more wildeness areas and not urban.
  * Guarded by rangers
* Priest/priestess seem friendly enough and will answer some questions but a perception check DC15, glassy eyed. Almost absentminded.
* High Priest Aimar Cracan, Eldarly Male Elf
  * Being controlled by a slave collar.
    * Tolded to encourage clergy to go on pilgrimages and reduce number of people at the temple to a minimum
    * The few worshippers that come 
    * Was asked about the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was at the heart of Blackpine forest
      * I was approached by someone impersonating an imperial historian. They wanted information on the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was said to have been built in the centre of Blackpine forest.
        * It was said that a grand temple was built there. A huge place where worshippers of Mielikki would go as a pilgrimage. 
        * It was there that the Heart of Mielikki was stored.
        * There was a corruption. No one knows what type. But the temple was ripped from this plane leaving the lake that is now at the centre of Blackpine.
#### Find who is Lord T
