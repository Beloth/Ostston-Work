## Next Session - ?

### Last Session
When the party made it to the entryway to the temple they found that the water pouring through had submerged the tunnel they used to get in. They also saw a cultist and a couple of devils wading through the water to get to them. They decided to make a quick getaway, downing the remaining water breathing potions. Eniaris in his giant octopus form towed the 2 heavy armour wears to shore while the rest of the party swim for it. Ahsoka made it safely ashore but due to the stress and strain of the previous fights both Kairon and Yojimbo struggled and eventually succumb to the water and slowly downing. Eniaris made a his way back to them, rescuing them from a watery grave.

They then decided to rest at the camp in order to recover, but they were interrupted during the night by 2 hell hounds. Deciding that they weren’t in any fit state to carry on the investigation they decided to head towards Ironhills where they would hopefully meet the reinforcements that Archanist Shanirra had sent. During their rest they did discover that the rod Kairon held was a Rod of the Pact Keeper and the amulet of Meliekki that Eniaris had allowed him to speak to 1 person while in wild shape for 1 hour per short rest.

On a path through the Forest they were confronted by a Female Tiefling holding a bow. She tells them that she has been tasked with hunting them down for disurpting the plans of the master. The party scatter but not before she releases 2 arrows into the party, 1 of which was a hail of thorns. Branton rushes to attack and doesn’t see the rope trap played along the path and is flung into the air suspended from a tree branch, where he remain for the rest of the fight The others move towards the Tiefling but are surprised by 4 dire wolves attack from both sides.

They suffer many wounds, enough to bring Kairon to unconsciousness due to Ogden’s eagerness to cause damage to the Dire wolves. Eventually they defeat the wolves but the Tiefling escaped and continued to harass then party from a distance with arrows and with traps laid in their path. I one particular moment both Branton and Eniaris, who was in his bear form, who were at the front, were trapped in bear traps while the rest of the party were peppered with arrows. 

Finally they made it out the forest and headed to Ironhills.
### Ironhills
#### Description
A very large village verging on a small town nestled between multiple hills in which appears the only flat peice of land around. To the north is the mountain range that denotes the border of Hestal and to the East is Blackpine Forrest. Watch towers on the tops of the surrounding hills prove some protecting or warning from harm. Mostly wooden buildings with a few more substantial stone based buildings in the centre. A well made central road runs through the centre heading south towards Ostston. Large warehouses dominate the sides of this road. Deep rut have formed showing how well used and heavy the goods are. Empty wagons are lined up by the warehouses. Several foundries can be seen belching out thick smoke as they smelt the various ores that came from the mines to the north.

#### Government
* Governer appointed by Rulers of Ostston
  * Kettering - Human male. Later 50's balding. Clothes are obviously finer than the average population of Ironhills but nothing compared to those of the Ostston
* Major eleccted by locals
  * Dain - Dwarven male. Blacksmith. Very down to earth
  
#### Guards 
Usually relatively low guard presense, but recently more have arrive due to loses of caravans

#### Guilds
Heavy mining and blacksmith presence. Large mercenary compliment used to guard caravans and warehouse. Also used as town protection.

### Party escort
* A guard company has arrive to escort the party back to Ostston. 
* Taken over one of the better inns
* Major Tharin lead them
* About 25 men in total

  * Won't be ready for a couple of weeks but will allow Archanist Shanirra to teleport people here when required

#### Major Tharin
Looks tired, has a fresh wound on his face, just missed his eye. Starting to scar over. Sitting at a table in the corner nursing a drink.  
*The cult uprising was larger than anyone expected. Hundreds dead. Eventually we won back the streets. We were luck that Lord Tanafrey's men help otherwise we may have been overrun. However as soon as it was put down the search for a scapegoat began and the city guard and High Marshal Felarn bore the brunt of it. Last I heard he has been relived of his duties pending an investigation*    

*Most of the top leadership of the guard is also under investigation. I was cleared on the word of the Archanist Shanierra but was told in no uncertain terms it would be better for my health if I left the city for a while. So here I am overseeing an increased guard for Ironhills*  

*The guard itself has been stood down from active duty. The city guard at least. Those outside continue but they are taking orders from... gods knows who now.*  

*Martial law was in place when we left with Tanafrey's men taking charge while they work out who in the city guard can be trusted*  

*An escort has also been arranged for your trip back to Ostston. Shanierra said you have more information about the cultists and their goals? Is there anything you can tell me that might help?*  

* Escort available staight away and can lend you 4 horses for the journey. 2 mounted guards. 2 days if rushed otherwise 3 days
* Escort available in 2 days with a caravan (4 wagons), lend you 4 horses but will travel at the speed of the caravan. 6 guards (2 mounted) 7 days travel. Will be taking iron, copper, tin, etc ingots to Ostston. Will pay them 100gp + 100gp danger pay per encounter.

## Back in Ostston
### Description
As you approach the entrance to the city you notice that while the number of people entering and leaving is much reduced the time taken to search them has increased with due to the guards being more through. The amount of guards has also doubled but are mainly dominated by those wearing the crest of the Tanafrey's. There are the odd city guard here and there.

As you enter the city proper you can see the damage caused by the attack. There are several burnt out buildings and many more showing various amounts of damage, smashed windows, broken doors. It also looks like several places have been looted, possibly by unscrupulous people taking advantage of the chaos.

The number of people out has also decreased, but they all keep their heads down not making eye contact with you or any others, quickly going about there business. Almost every street corner has a pair of guards fully armed. 

### Archanist Shanirra
#### Description
The Archanist looks tired. her clothing rumpled as if she hasn't changed in a number of days. The heavy bags under her eyes and meesy hair also indicates her lack of sleep. She attempts a small smile in your direction which comes out more like a grimace.

*So what did you find out in the forest?* 

*I've been trying to keep order in the city but without Marshall Felarn and the city guard its been a struggle. Lord Tanafrey has been a god send. With his help we managed to contain the cultist but not without cost. We lost maybe 60 city guardsman, with another 100 or so injured. You've probably seen the damage to the city. What's worst is the fear that has enveloped the city. People don't know who to trust anymore. Since then there have been protests which have had to be forcfully put down. Marshal Felarn has been made a scapegoat and has been place under house arrest pending an investigation.*

*For now I don't have the resources to continue to investigate the goings on with the cult unless you have a solid lead of what their goals are*

### Goals
* Help Marshal Felarn clear his name
* Investigate the cult more fully
  * Head to the temple of Meleikki to investigate
  * Kairon's patron gives him a lead
* Branton learns of the Order of the Righteous Gods

## Kairon's Dream
You find yourself I a enormous room dominated at the far end by an immense figure sitting behind an equally large table. There seems to be hundreds of people your size almost floating towards it. When you take a closer look they arn't all people, but a mixture of people of all races and just as many devils and fiends all facing the figure at the end. You feel a tug and you find yourself joining the flow of people.*    

Its strange.. as you move closer, rather that getting bigger, the figure seems to shrink until it is maybe the size of a giant by the time you are in front of it. Its wearing a robe that covers most of its features but you spot small protrusions emerging from the hood and notice the red skin of a Tiefling, if Tieflings grew to giant size that is. It  appears to be writing on some parchment with a quill. Its aura surrounds you and recognise it as your patron despite of what it looks like.  

What have you found out about Malachar's cultists?  

As you describe what you've found his aura becomes more and more oppressive until you can barely force the words out. He lets out a roar of anger and for a brief second the illusion around him flickers and you get to see his true form for a second...  

It took much of our resources on this plane the last time he made a play for the Heart of Mielikki and we are only just getting to the same stage. You will stop them from getting the Heart of Mielikki at all costs. Malachar must not be allowed to corrupt it or he will make a play to retake his former holdings.
