## Next Session - 29th Nov 2018

### Last Session

The party started in a small underwater cave which had a bricked up exit with a small hole at the bottom that was allowing a small stream of water flow through into the cave. They decide to break through, opening up a small tunnel which led to a room with 2 exits. One was blocked up in a similar manner to the previous one. As they investigated the room a ghostly knight appeared which upon seeing Kairon challenged they. Branton sees the crest on the knight shield and recognised part of it as the symbol of Torn. The crest as a whole sparked a bit of recognition but in the heat of the moment he could not place it. The knight also saw that Branton was a follower of Torn and relaxes his stance. He explained the a devilish cult had invaded this place and had bound him to a stone lying in the corner. If they take the stone to his resting place he will give them information on how to get to the Seal room which seemed to be of interest to the cult

They agree and leave through the second door. They find the room which the knight described to then that holds 3 skeletons. 2 of which seemed to be of knights as they have the remains of plate armour. As they approach the ghostly knight approaches the third body and as it does so changes it appearance to a much smaller and younger person, a squire. It tells the party of a secret entrance to  the Seal room, however they need to find the key.

Exploring further the party finds another room which contained a diary which provides some further information of what occurred here.

Diary Entries

1
We've gathered the non-combatants and a couple of the injured knights and sealed the floor. The high priest has activated the wards. Nothing should be able to get through and only he can deavitate them. We are safe 
Some fiends managed to sneak passed before the wards went up. Sir Kenath gave his life protecting the children. Ser Jenny was further injured preventing then from reaching Mielikki's Seal. We've bandaged her wounds but wit limited supplies we couldn't clean it properly 
Its been a number of days since the wards went up and no hint that the attack has been beaten off... 
2
My suspicions were well founded. While everyone else slept I went to look where the bodies were being kept. Chunks of flesh have been removed. I think... I think we've been eating them... what are we becoming... 
I can bear it no longer. We have become feral animals. Eating our dead. Something must be done... 
To my shame I have killed those I swore to protect. To anyone reading this, I confess I poisoned the remaining water with a sleeping draught and killed them while they slept. I fear I will never see Mielikki's light but to allow them to degenerate further into cannibalism would be unthinkable. The same dagger that ended their lives will end mine. 
3
I've inspected the seal and cross referenced it with the designs and noticed that there are difference. Extra runes here and there. 
The runes are in Infernal and unfortunately no one here can read them. So I'll never know what they were trying to do. But at least we stopped them. 
Sir Jenny's wounds have become infected. She's dying and there is nothing I can do about it. What little medicine we have can not cure it so I have administered some sleeping draught to help ease the pain. 
4
The children are too weak now. They can barely move. Petro believes that we should give up on them and that their rations would help the adults survive until the tunnel is complete. He was shouted down. 
Petro attempted to kill Lena thinking that we would believe she had died of hunger. Wenal went into a frenzy and has badly injured Petro. 
We've had another rat stew. I'm grateful but its curious. I've not seen any rats around.... 
Petro's has died of his wounds. He wasn't a bad man but I can find little sympathy for him. 
I think its been a 2 weeks but its hard to tell when there's no light. 
  
They continue on and find the room which the ghost told them held the secret entrance. Its hidden behind a mural of a forest scene. The missing key appears to be a missing part of the mural where there is a circle hole which would be the head of a 4 legged animal.

They continue to search for this key coming upon what appears to be a storage area. Branton takes the lead and enters the room look at the crates followed by Ahsoka and Ogden. As Branton bends down to inspect the crates, Ogden and Ahsoka look up to see a black mass practically fall on top of Branton. A sizzling can be heard as acid eats into Branton's armour. The Black pudding attacks and as the party defends itself from ranged where possible to avoid the acidic splash back. Branton's slashing attack force the pudding to split several times before he succumbs. Ahsoka's attempt to attack from range ends up with Yojimbo taking a throwing star into his side. 

After defeating the pudding they found 2 medallions along with some other treasure. One appears to be the missing part of the mural and the other emanates a magic aura and is given to Eniaris for the time being. Back at the mural, Kairon places the other medallion on the mural and two centaurs charge out of the mural attacking the party. After defeating them they notice that the eyes in the medallion can be changed to different colours. They were green so they change them to blue and place it again against the mural. This time the door is revealed. 

From there they can see into the Seal room where several cultists are passing supplies through what appears to be a tear in space above a runic seal, while a tiefling and some sort of devil looks on. There appears to be a female magic user in some sort of bubble who is holding the tear open. Believing the odds were against them they party head back to the entrance to tear down the other blocked door. 

As Branton starts to make a hole a spear is suddenly thrust through, injuring him. After several attempts to continue to take the blockage down. Kairon sends his familiar as a spider through to see who is attacking through the holes they make. There appears to be 6 or more devils laying in wait for them. 

They decide that maybe that was too many for them to take on so attempt to block the way up again before heading back to the secret entrance to the Seal room where they now just see the tiefling, devil and magic user. Thinking they could take them, Branton charges in only to see several cultist they were working in the corner and out of sight. A battle ensues and while the cultists are taken down with ease the tiefling and devil are more difficult foes and several of the party fall unconscious. Ogden seems to be singled out as the healer and the magic user doesn't seem to be able to aid her allies as she is concentrating on something else. 

When the tiefling seemed about to fall he disengages and heads back to the magic user, taking a box that was on a plinth leaps into the tear. The magic user dissipates the bubble throwing the party to the ground. She casts some sort of spell on the seal before disappearing. As the party starts to investigate the room the seal lights up and a blast of energy shoots up cracking the ceiling, which begins to fall, water coming through. Continuing to search the room Kairon finds a rod on one of the cultists before the ceiling collapses and water rushes in. 

The party run back the way they came, barrelling through and killing two spine devils that seemed surprised to see and charging dwarf running straight at them. They eventually make it to the first room they entered through.

### Cave

* Bricked up enterance - trickle of water coming from the base of the blockage
* Investigation - Relatively recent, couple of weeks. Not well made
* Could be taken down. Quitely and slow (DC15) or noisy and fast (DC10). Strength or Athletics roll - if Ogden does it lower DC or advantage. 
* Opens up to a narrow bare earth tunnel. Relatively short and leads to a square room

### Enterance Room

* Square room maybe 20x20
* Walls slick with moisture and green with algae
* 2 exits 
  * 1 straight ahead has a closed door
  * 1 to the right has been blocked up in a similar manner to the way you entered
* The hole you entered through was not originally a door. A hole in the wall was made and the tunnel dug out. Investigation to find that the tunnel is old. There are signs that is was enlarged recently but the original tunnel is very old.

* Passive perception DC14 - After a few minutes you notice that the temperature in the room is  dropping.. rapidly. 
  * Perception Check DC12 - A mist is forming around a stone? and spreading out in the NW corner
* Emerging from the stone is a blurry, ghostly figure. After a moment it solidified into a large 6'2" humanoid figure. Looking at him he his wearing full plate mail, heater shield on one arm and a sheathed long sword. Upon the shield and his tabard have 3 connected circles with symbols in them.
  * Dropbox pic1.jpg
  1) Fist - White right gauntlet - Torm
  2) Scales and a hammer - Balanced scales resting on a warhammer - Tyr
  3) Hands - Hands bound at the wrist with red cord - Ilmater
* Branton make a intelligence check
  * 0-10 You recognise it from somewhere but you can't put your finger on where
  * 11-15 That's the symbol for "The Right Knights of Good"!
* Ghost surveys the group but when he spots Kairon, he draws his sword, declaring  
  *More devil kin. You shall not pass!*
  
#### Garon, Knight of the Rightous Gods, Ghost

* Large human, 6'2"
* Ornate Full Plate mail, intricate patterns
* Fine long sword
* Heater Shield
* Clean shaven
* Blonde Blue eyes
* Heroic stance

*So you claim you do not work for them* 

*I tried to stop them from entering but there were too many and the witch bound me to this stone.*  
Points to the stone in the corner.  
*If you carry the stone back to my resting place I will aid you*  
*Head down the corridoor where there are 5 rooms. I lay in the last, largest of those rooms*   
*When word came that the temple was besieged we set out from our northern stronghold with 100 knights. We were to hold off the invaders till our Dwarven allies could bring to bare a relief force. We broke through the siege lines and re-enforced the garrison while we waited for the army hit them in the rear. However the army never arrived and we were eventually overrun. We move the most vulnerable, non-combatants and children that were stuck here, down to the lowest level of the temple and the priest errected their fail safe runes making it impossible for them to enter although a few got through before the wards went up*    
*Devil and their worshippers attacked*  
Before he fades *Be warned a few creatures have made this place their home and I have been unable to drive them off*   
* Suggests that you don't go down the blocked route. They brought many helpers so you woud have to fight through them all
* Like to be in the Seal room
* Other hidden enterance if you follow him

### 1st Room - The Bone room

* Many bones. Withered with age.. the damp not helping
  * Nature check
    * 1-10 maybe 10-15 different sets of humaniod bones
    * 11-15 Some of the them are children..
    * 16+ They have bite marks...

* 3 set of armour
  * Any thing not metal has rotted away
  * The metal armour shows corrosion
  * Not usable in current state... might be repairable?
* 1 set of bones
  * all layed out hands over their chests with swords in hand.
* Garon emerges and drifts over towards the set of bones as he does he shrinks.. his armour fading to nothing and he is actually garbed in plain leather. He turns to you and says thank you. You see that is is probably no more than 14-15 years old. A squire  
*Turn right out of this room then take the next right, then the 1st right will take you the preperation room. Solve the riddle and the is a secret tunnel into the Seal room.*    

### 3rd Room - Study

* Desk with chair
* Bedding along one wall
* Couple of bookcases

  * Investigation check DC12 to find that the knive was probably self inflicted
* On the desk is a diary, but the moisture in the air has caused alot of damage
  * Investigation check to find what is left.
* Bookcase all books badly damaged.

#### Diary
* We've gathered the non-combatants and a couple of the injured knights and sealed the floor. The high priest has activated the wards. Nothing should be able to get through and only he can deavitate them. We are safe
* Some fiends managed to sneak passed before the wards went up. Sir Kenath gave his life protecting the children. Ser Jenny was further injured preventing then from reaching Mielikki's Seal. We've bandaged her wounds but wit limited supplies we couldn't clean it properly
* Its been a number of days since the wards went up and no hint that the attack has been beaten off...
* Supplies are running low... we've had to ration things, water isn't an issue but food is.
* It been decided to try to tunnel our way out. I don't think that we'll be able to do it. Too little food
* To take my mind off the hunger I've been investigating why the fiends were heading to the Seal room. The books tell me that the room was designed to allow the roots of the Blessed tree to grow around Mielikki's Heart and down into the seal so that the tree could draw on a "cleaner" source of power greaty enchancing it blessing
* I've inspected the seal and cross referenced it with the designs and noticed that there are difference. Extra runes here and there.
* The runes are in Infernal and unfortunately no one here can read them. So I'll never know what they were trying to do. But at least we stopped them.
* Sir Jenny's wounds have become infected. She's dying and there is nothing I can do about it. What little medicine we have can not cure it so I have administered som sleeping draught to help ease the pain.
* Sir Jenny has surcome. We've laid her body next to Sir Kenath, but I noticed something strange. His armour has been tampered with. Did someone move him? Take something off the body?
* The first child has died. Wenal is inconsolable. She is blaming herself for not giving up her rations. We stored the body in one of the unused rooms.
* Nena has found some meat. Rats apparently, but that's enough to give people some hope.
* The children are too weak now. They can barely move. Petro believes that we should give up on them and that their rations would help the adults survive until the tunnel is complete. He was shouted down.
* Petro attempted to kill Lena thinking that we would believe she had died of hunger. Wenal went into a frenzy and has badly injured Petro.
* We've had another rat stew. I'm grateful but its curious. I've not seen any rats around....
* Petro's has died of his wounds. He wasn't a bad man but I can find little sympathy for him.
* I think its been a 2 weeks but its hard to tell when there's no light. 
* My suspicions were well founded. While everone else slept I went to look where the bodies were being kept. Chunks of flesh have been removed. I think... I think we've been eating them... what are we becoming...
* I can bear it no longer. We have become feral animals. Eating our dead. Somthing must be done...
* To my shame I have killed those I swore to protect. To anyone reading this, I confess I poisoned the remaining water with a sleeping draught and killed them while they slept. I fear I will never see Mielikki's light but to allow them to degenerate further into cannibalism would be unthinkable. The same dagger that ended their lives will end mine.

### Ironhills
#### Description
A very large village verging on a small town nestled between multiple hills in which appears the only flat peice of land around. Watch towers on the tops of the surrounding hills prove some protecting or warning from harm. Mostly wooden buildings with a few more substantial stone based buildings in the centre. A well made central road runs through the centre heading south towards Ostston. Large warehouses dominate the sides of this road. Deep rut have formed showing how well used and heavy the goods are. Empty wagons are lined up by the warehouse. 

#### Government
* Governer appointed by Rulers of Ostston
  * Kettering - Human male. Later 50's balding. Clothes are obviously finer than the average population of Ironhills but nothing compared to those of the Ostston
* Major eleccted by locals
  * Dain - Dwarven male. Blacksmith. Very down to earth
  
#### Guards 
Usually relatively low guard presense, but recently more have arrive due to loses of caravans

#### Guilds
Heavy mining and blacksmith presence. Large mercenary compliment used to guard caravans and warehouse. Also used as town protection.

### Party escort
* A guard company has arrive to escort the party back to Ostston. 
* Taken over one of the better inns
* Major Tharin lead them
* About 25 men in total

#### Major Tharin
Looks tired, has a fresh wound on his face, just missed his eye. Starting to scar over. Sitting at a table in the corner nursing a drink.  
*The cult uprising was larger than anyone expected. Hundreds dead. Eventually we won back the streets. We were luck that Lord Tanafrey's men help otherwise we may have been overrun. However as soon as it was put down the search for a scapegoat began and the city guard and High Marshal Felarn bore the brunt of it. Last I heard he has been relived of his duties pending an investigation*    

*Most of the top leadership of the guard is also under investigation. I was cleared on the word of the Archanist Shanierra but was told in no uncertain terms it would be better for my health if I left the city for a while. So here I am overseeing an increased guard for Ironhills*  

*The guard itself has been stood down from active duty. The city guard at least. Those outside continue but they are taking orders from... gods knows who now.*  

*Martial law was in place when we left with Tanafrey's men taking charge while they work out who in the city guard can be trusted*  

*An escort has also been arranged for your trip back to Ostston. Shanierra said you have more information about the cultists and their goals? Is there anything you can tell me that might help?*  

* Escort available staight away and can lend you 4 horses for the journey. 2 mounted guards. 2 days if rushed otherwise 3 days
* Escort available in 2 days with a caravan (4 wagons), lend you 4 horses but will travel at the speed of the caravan. 6 guards (2 mounted) 7 days travel. Will be taking iron, copper, tin, etc ingots to Ostston. Will pay them 100gp + 100gp danger pay per encounter.

## Kairon's Dream
You find yourself I a enormous room dominated at the far end by an immense figure sitting behind an equally large table. There seems to be hundreds of people your size almost floating towards it. When you take a closer look they arn't all people, but a mixture of people of all races and just as many devils and fiends all facing the figure at the end. You feel a tug and you find yourself joining the flow of people.*    

Its strange.. as you move closer, rather that getting bigger, the figure seems to shrink until it is maybe the size of a giant by the time you are in front of it. Its wearing a robe that covers most of its features but you spot small protrusions emerging from the hood and notice the red skin of a Tiefling, if Tieflings grew to giant size that is. It  appears to be writing on some parchment with a quill. Its aura surrounds you and recognise it as your patron despite of what it looks like.  

What have you found out about Malachar's cultists?  

As you describe what you've found his aura becomes more and more oppressive until you can barely force the words out. He lets out a roar of anger and for a brief second the illusion around him flickers and you get to see his true form for a second...  

It took much of our resources on this plane the last time he made a play for the Heart of Mielikki and we are only just getting to the same stage. You will stop them from getting the Heart of Mielikki at all costs. Malachar must not be allowed to corrupt it or he will make a play to retake his former holdings.
