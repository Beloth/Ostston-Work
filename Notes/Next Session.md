## Previous session

The 4 at the inn come down after a good rest to find the inn busy, the innkeeper hands Yojimbo a note from Talissa given him the final information she has gathered about Seymour. Yojimbo then tries to get information from him about what the inn is so busy. He is told about the earth temor that happened last night which cause alot of damaged and a section of the city to collapse. He also is surprised that the party hadn't felt it. The 4 decide to head to the temple to meet up with the other 2 before heading to help with the aftermath.

The 2 in the temple find it almost deserted as most are out helping with the injured. They wait for the rest of the party before heading to help. They find where the wounded are being sent to and spot healer from around the city giving aid. Branton attempts for help a man with a broken leg whilst searching him for the mark of Malachar. In doing so he is rather rather with him and caused him to cry out multiple times. A senior cleric rushes across to see what is happening and Branton wisely decides to leave the triaging to the others. Those that are capable start helping with other injured and Yojimbo trys to question the one he is helping with little success.

Branton then tried to talk to one of the guards that seem to be directing the others. Yojimbo used message to try to direct the conversation but unfortunately Branton doesn't realise its him and begins to think his god is talking to him. The guard suggests that they head back to the keep and report back to Captain Jardon.

They do so and are lead into what appears to be the Marshal's office where Jardon and alot of others seem to be in the process of organising the response to the tragedy. Branton describes what the party did in the cavern, gets carried away and kind of implies that they may have been responsible in some small way for the disaster. Marshal Waylynn immediatedely calls for their arrest and lays the blame solely on them. Captain Jardon tells them not to resist and they lay down their weapons. They are striped of all equipment and sent to the cells. A bit later Branton is allowed to a released under house arrest as long as he gives an oath not to leave.

During the night Jardon fetches Branton and leads him back to the cells where he frees the rest of the party, giving them back their equipment and tells them about his worries over the Marshal's loyalities. He asks them to investigate this before leaveing for Ostston and reporting to Major Tharin. He tells them of the 2 properties here in Highcastle and the estate on the outskirts. The party decides to head to his main residances that should be empty.

They search the places finding a main study on the ground floor, where they come across a large tapastry that concealed a wall safe. With none able to pick a lock, Branton attempts to force it open triggering a poison needle trap. Within the safe they find a bag of 50 gold, a pouch of 7 gems, 1 healing potion and a ledger. The ledger contain information on the household expenses.

On the upper floor they find a smaller private study where Eniaris finds a half completed letter to Lord and Lady Batovian (Branton's parents), claiming a friendship with him.

Not wanting to risk the Mistress house still the Marshal was there, the party head to an inn to wait till dawn and the opening of the city gates. Moving in pairs they eventually make it out of the city and head to the estate. They decided to camp by the main road until its dark. While waiting Kairon identifies his familiar, and Imp which Yojimbo decides to name Germimia. They use it to scout out the Country house.

Ashoka sneaks up to the house with the objective of climbing up to an unlocked window. Unfortunately Yojimbo attempts to follow and isn't as sneaky has he thought he was, attracting a patrol. Ashoka darted to the house and managed to find a hiding place while Yojimbo drops to the floors and uses minor illusion to try to distract the guard away from him, eventually successfully.

Ashoka makes it into the house and starts exploring, trying to find a way to let the others in. Unfortunately the plan to open the back door from the kitchen is ruined when it appears that the kitchen is occupied. Becoming more and more stressed as time goes on without abling to find an enterance, Ashoka's luck finally runs out as is confronted by a pair of guards. She attempts to make a run for it but is eventually cornered and taken prisoner. The guard announce that they will call for the magistrate in the morning.
