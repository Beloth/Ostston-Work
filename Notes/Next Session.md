## Next Session

### Gnome dwelling

Gnome name: Orla Ashstaff

Having tea round the table

"You should be safe here, at least for a while. This place is well hidden." 
"Not enough food stored for long term though so you'll need to work on way out"

Chip, the small chipmonk can be seen dragging what for a human would be a cane but for the Gnome is more like a staff.

"Thank you Chip" as she uses it to pull herself up. 
"Afraid the beds are going to be too small for most of you, but there should be room in the living room and the library for you to stretch out.

### Library

Contains many books

* History of the Cities of Hestal
* Several books on the theory of various magical pratices
* Several lore books

On the desk there seems to be reems of pachment

* Closer looks it appears to be a manuscript entitled "The Lore and Legends of Blackpine Forrest"
  * The Gnome was in the process of finishing the book
  
#### The Lore and Legends of Blackpine Forrest

* Once beleived to be a magical forest blessed by the Goddess Meleikki
* A hugh temple was built in the centre of the forest by her followers
* Instead of a natural grove which is normal for her, they cut down large area and built a cold stone temple.
  * Believe the High Priest had be corrupted. The timber was sold for large amounts.
* Temple disappeared along with large amounts of the surrounding ground leaving a giant lake in the centre.
* All magic soon disipated

* Legends of a guardian of the Forest. An acient Treant.
  * Fought those who tried to cut down the trees
  * Made a treaty with the City State of Ostston to limit what they could chop down
  * Believe to still be around, sleeping deeply.

* The wolf pack. Uncommonly large wolves have been spotted in the forest
  * Roam around the lake. 
  * Thought to be unnatural due to their large size and uncanny intelligence
  * An escaped experiment 

#### Archanist Shaniera 

* Tries to contact the party but the connection is weak.

"Salamander S... Can you ... me"  
"You must .. . distance..... was not designed as.... device"  
"I can't .... your location"  
"Something or  .... must .. blocking"  
"Add ... of. ... power to it to... the connection"  

"Ok, I've got a rough location. You appear to be somewhere around the South Western Edge of Blackpine forest"  
"What have you found. I take it the portal is linked to there"  
"The city is under martial law. The cultists had infiltrated alot deeper than we feared and it took a while for the guard to get organised. Thank the gods that Lord Tarafrey had leant the city some of his guard. The death toll would have be greater without them."  

"We are still unsure of their reasons. Several are being questions now but they appear to be fanatics and would rather die"  
"Do you have any information?"  
"The immediate threat seems to have been neutralised."
"I'm forbidden by a binding oath to enter Blackpine unless something is directly threating Ostston"  
"Find out as much as you can but get to Ironhill in 2 weeks. That's the soonest 1 of my asosicates can be there to get you back"

### Next morning

Howls in early morning alert the party that hounds are near. Spot several sniffing around the various trees nearby but don't seem to have an exact location

The Erinyes approaches but she is also with a Male Tiefling in blood red plate armour and a half elf female in an intricate robe with mystical runes glowing. 

* Branton make a intelligance check Dc15
  * Success - That is Ameria, the daughter of the current headmistress of the University and a powerful Sorceress
  * Fail - She is familiar to you but you can't pinpoint from where
  
Tiefling speaks.  "Come out, your surrounded"

If nothing is done he will turn to Ameria, "You're sure?"

She nods, lifts her hand with a crystal in it and waves it in front of her while starring unblinking at it.

* Whoever has Shaniera's orb make a perception check DC15
  * Pass - It shivers every time the crytal passes by it.
  * Fail - nothing
  
After a beat she looks directly at the tree.. "There"

* Orla will tell Chip to lead you out the back way while she creates a distraction
  * Takes a ring off her finger and gives it to Ahsoka. "This has been in my family for generations. I give this to you, better in your hands than theirs.
  * Taps her staff on the ground a couple of times and the orb on the top starts to glow.
  * Her back staightens and her whole demeaner changes from old frail woman, to powerful mages. But you can sense partially for show. The power, while potent seems to be stuttering, fading in and out.
