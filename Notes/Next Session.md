## Next Session

### Enterance to the vault

* As the party approaches the enterance they can hear sounds of battle from all around the temple. Looking around they will see clashes between the temple guards and presumably the cultist, but its nearly impossible to tell which is which as they are all dressed in temple uniforms. You can hear explosions from the balcony indicating that the Archanist is still fighting.
* The High Priest speaks to one of the rangers, "show these adventures to the vault. I must rally the faithful."  
  * He turns to the party "Good luck. Stop whatever terror they are building too, should we survive this I'll tell you whatever I can remember"  
  * He booms out in a powerful voice. "Devotess of Meilikki! To arms, there are traitors unmongst us! Rally to the Tree of Meilikki!
  
* As the party starts down the enterance to the vault they can see 2 large parties of faithful heading towards the tree...

#### Ranger of Meilikki

Name: Oarlith  
Race: Half Elf  
Gender: Male  

* Shaken by the betrayal but determined to fulfill his duty.

### Vault under the tree of Meilikki

Was originally a cave system but several decades ago, when there was a period of civil unrest, it was dug out and converted into a safe haven for the faithful. Now used mainly as a storage space. Not many are allowed access to it. As time went on new rooms were dug out closer to the enterance and the main vault fell into disuse.

#### Path to Vault

Single path leading down. Several branches off, narrower than the main path. Leads to newer rooms that were added. If time spent investigating the stone work is newer. 

* 1st 4 branches lead to rooms that are full of storage:
  * Books - Perception check DC 15 Several of the shelves seem to be missing books, recently to judging by the lack of dust in the spaces.

* Oarlith stops the party a a certain point and tells them to only step where he does. If the party  questions. Its a failsafe to stop unauthorised people from getting to the main vault.   
* Ahead the path splits into 3. These are the 3 original caverns found down here. Not in use due to the distance from the enterance.
  * Perception check DC 14. 
    * Success - sounds of movement up ahead. Faint glow of torchlight.
    * "Listen... it wasm't my fault. How was I to know to bring the emergancy supplies"
    * "He, it, whatever... said to bring everything..."
    * "Shh.. what was that"
