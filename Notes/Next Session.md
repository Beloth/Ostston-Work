## Session 6 - 17th October

#### Previous session

Kairon headed to the bookstore where he was told that the information broker was. As he approached he heard a cry of pain a from inside the store and he rush in. Both Branton and Ogden were trailing he and entered as well. Ashoka you was also told that the information broker may have information for him also entered. Once inside they found the store in disarray. Branton who was distrustful of Kairon the Tiefling accused him of causing it. After a discussion the group decide to head to the back room where they found a dead man and a bleeding out half-elf. Ogden failed to stabilize the half-elf whi sliped into unconsiousness. Ashoka took over and managed to keep the half-elf from dying. After more discussion they head you the stairs that were behind one of the bookcases.

In the room above they across 3 dead bodies, one of which on lying across the desk with a dagger sticking out of him and a female elf standing over the body. Next to her was Yojimbo, a bronze dragonborn. After a brief discussion they are interupted by the opening of a secret enterance and a dwarf appear who takes up a defensive position next the elf who is the Information Broker Talissa. 

After a time Talissa agrees to start looking for the information that the party is interested in. Initially Talissa wanted to be paid as in her words Information is expensive. However the price was too high for Kairon who offered to pay in deeds. Talissa accepted and the group, now including Yojimbo, heads to the sewers to clear the room where Talissa will be setting up.

After battling through several giant rats and swarms of rats the party make it the room where they scare a giant rat who hides in a whole in the wall. As they search the room the rat seems to ran towards the trap door which Yojimbo was standing next to. Mid may towards the trap door it changes into a wererat and attacks Yojimbo, surprising the rest of the party. After knocking him into unconciousness, the wererat heads to Kairon and proceeds to bite and claw at him. The party recovering from their surprise manage to kill the wererat and start to loot the room. While doing so they hear some footsteps coming from behind a bookcase, which opens to revel the dwarf Grundel and several others. 

He proceeds to tell the party to head back to Talissa who has setup in a warehouse while he finishes setup the room for business. The 1st job seems to be blocking off the way the party got to the room, after they leave that way. Back at Talissa she has started the process of gathering the information and already has a lead. She points you in the direction of a some lawyers. The party starts to search for them but the information isn't exact and they try to speak to several groups. This seems to spook 1 group and Ashoka follows a messager that heads towards a warehouse. After a brief time the message returns towards the lawyers. Ashoka waits long enough to see another person leave the warehouse.
