## Next Session - 29th Nov 2018

### Last Session

The party investigates the camp site. In what appears to be the dwelling of the leaders, they found documents with information about the next supply run to the camp, increased patorls for the heartstone transportation, the abandoned camp site used as a base for the digging in the centre of the lake and that the Central orb was to be transported soon. They also found a hidden diary with information on the Sons and Daughters of the master.  

They freed the slaves who began to build a fire and prepare a meal. The party decides to wait for the resupply ran and try to ambush it. They dig a ditch trap in which they hoped any guard who fall ito. Unfortunately the resupply guards were too cautious and the ditch hindered the party more than the guards. They were however easily overcome and after taking a share of the supplies the rest were given to the freed slaves to allow them to travel to Iron Hill.   

The party then decided to head to the abandoned camp, where they found several waterbreathing potions.Eniaris wild shaped into an Giant Octopus who dragged Ahsoka who had take one of the potions to explore the bottom of the lake. Near the centre they found a cave that had an air pocket with what appeared to be a bricked up enterance. They returned to collect the rest of the party who used some of the water breathing potions to get to the cave.   

### Cave

* Bricked up enterance - trickle of water coming from the base of the blockage
* Investigation - Relatively recent, couple of weeks. Not well made
* Could be taken down. Quitely and slow (DC15) or noisy and fast (DC10). Strength or Athletics roll - if Ogden does it lower DC or advantage. 
* Opens up to a narrow bare earth tunnel. Relatively short and leads to a square room

### Enterance Room

* Square room maybe 20x20
* Walls slick with moisture and green with algae
* 2 exits 
  * 1 straight ahead has a closed door
  * 1 to the right has been blocked up in a similar manner to the way you entered
* The hole you entered through was not originally a door. A hole in the wall was made and the tunnel dug out. Investigation to find that the tunnel is old. There are signs that is was enlarged recently but the original tunnel is very old.

* Passive perception DC14 - After a few minutes you notice that the temperature in the room is  dropping.. rapidly. 
  * Perception Check DC12 - A mist is forming around a stone? and spreading out in the NW corner

* Emerging from the stone is a blurry, ghostly figure. After a moment it solidified into a large 6'2" humanoid figure. Looking at him he his wearing full plate mail, heater shield on one arm and a sheathed long sword. Upon the shield and his tabard have 3 connected circles with symbols in them.
  * Dropbox pic1.jpg
  1) Fist - White right gauntlet - Torm
  2) Scales and a hammer - Balanced scales resting on a warhammer - Tyr
  3) Hands - Hands bound at the wrist with red cord - Ilmater
* Branton make a intelligence check
  * 0-10 You recognise it from somewhere but you can't put your finger on where
  * 11-15 That's the symbol for "The Right Knights of Good"!
* Ghost surveys the group but when he spots Kairon, he draws his sword, declaring  
  ```More devil kin. You shall not pass!```
  
#### Garon, Knight of the Rightous Gods, Ghost

* Large human, 6'2"
* Ornate Full Plate mail, intricate patterns
* Fine long sword
* Heater Shield
* Clean shaven
* Blonde Blue eyes
* Heroic stance

```So you claim you do not work for them```  
```I tried to stop them from entering but there were too many and the witch bound me to this stone.```   
Points to the stone in the corner.  
```If you carry the stone back to my resting place I will aid you```  
```Head down the corridoor where there are 5 rooms. I lay in the last, largest of those rooms```  
``` When word came that the temple was besieged we set out with 100 knights in advance of the main army. We broke through the siege lines and re-enforced the garrison while we waited for the army hit them in the rear. However the army never arrived and we were eventually overrun. We move the most vulnerable, non-combatants and children that were stuck here, down to the lowest level of the temple and the priest errected their fail safe runes making it impossible for them to enter although a few got through before the wards went up ```  
``` Devil and their worshippers attacked```
Before he fades ``` Be warned a few creatures have made this place their home and I have been unable to drive them off``` 
* Suggests that you don't go down the blocked route. They brought many helpers so you woud have to fight through them all
* Like to be in the Seal room
* Other hidden enterance if you follow him

### 1st Room - The Bone room

* Many bones. Withered with age.. the damp not helping
  * Nature check
    * 1-10 maybe 10-15 different sets of humaniod bones
    * 11-15 Some of the them are children..
    * 16+ They have bite marks...

### 2nd Room - Knight's Rest

  * Any thing not metal has rotted away
  * The metal armour shows corrosion
  * Not usable in current state... might be repairable?
* 1 set of bones
  * all layed out hands over their chests with swords in hand.
* Garon emerges and drifts over towards the set of bones as he does he shrinks.. his armour fading to nothing and he is actually garbed in plain leather. He turns to you and says thank you. You see that is is probably no more than 14-15 years old. A squire
``` Turn right out of this room then take the next right, then the 1st right will take you the preperation room. Solve the riddle and the is a secret tunnel into the Seal room.```
