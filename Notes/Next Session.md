## Next Session - 29th Nov 2018

### Last Session

The party investigates the camp site. In what appears to be the dwelling of the leaders, they found documents with information about the next supply run to the camp, increased patorls for the heartstone transportation, the abandoned camp site used as a base for the digging in the centre of the lake and that the Central orb was to be transported soon. They also found a hidden diary with information on the Sons and Daughters of the master.  

They freed the slaves who began to build a fire and prepare a meal. The party decides to wait for the resupply ran and try to ambush it. They dig a ditch trap in which they hoped any guard who fall ito. Unfortunately the resupply guards were too cautious and the ditch hindered the party more than the guards. They were however easily overcome and after taking a share of the supplies the rest were given to the freed slaves to allow them to travel to Iron Hill.   

The party then decided to head to the abandoned camp, where they found several waterbreathing potions.Eniaris wild shaped into an Giant Octopus who dragged Ahsoka who had take one of the potions to explore the bottom of the lake. Near the centre they found a cave that had an air pocket with what appeared to be a bricked up enterance. They returned to collect the rest of the party who used some of the water breathing potions to get to the cave.   

### Cave
