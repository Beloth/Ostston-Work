#### The Information Broker

##### Outside

You are surprised to find that the building appears to be a bookstore. It appears to be a 2 story corner plot with the store front on the main road and the side having a narrow alley. The front has a large window displaying various books.

###### Side alley 

Dark narrow alley. Wide enough for just 1 person to walk down comfortably, 2 would be a bit of a squeeze. 
  * Investigation DC 25 to spot a false wall.
    * Investigation DC 30 to find the lock
    * Investigation DC 25 to spot the sleeping gas trap
    * Thieves tools check of DC 30 to be able to unlock

##### Ground floor

As you enter you see signs of a struggle which leads to the backroom. There you see a single female half elf slumped, hand holding a chest wound that is bleeding badly, next to a bookcase that has swung outwards at a 45 degree angle. Infront is another body of a human male blood leak out of his cut throat.

Looking past the bookcase you see a flight of stairs leading upwards.

###### Female half elf

* Wearing what you would expect a shopkeeper in a middle class shop would wear. Well made by practical clothes.
* You do notice a dagger by her side that she has obviously dropped to clutch at her wound.
* Still alive but fading fast.
  * Medicine check DC 15 to stablise
  
###### Male human

* Wearing a some sort of uniform.
  * Investigation check
    * DC less than 10 - Underneath the the uniform is leather armour
    * 10-15 - several hidden daggers on him
    * 15+ - on closer inspection the uniform is rather badly made. Good enough to pass a casual glance but wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny. 
* Clutching at this throat with a surprised look on his face  

##### Entering the upstairs room 

* Upon entering the room you see what looks like a office. There is a single body lying across the entrance dressed in a similar fashion to those below. The room is dominated by a large desk across which is another body from which a female elf is withdrawing a dagger from one of its eye sockets. She looks you at you with a feral grin. 

##### Room description

A large office space with many bookcases and filing cabinets along the walls. A single large desk behind which is a largish window with blinds drawn down hiding the room from anyone attempting to look in by allow enough light through. Scattered around the room are books and parchment likely a testament to the fight that must have just taken place. There is another body on the floor in addition to the other 2, lying between the entrance and the desk

"Well what do we have here.... you don't appear to be with them" she nods her head to the bodies, "I don't know you and yet you enter my domain with weapons drawn"

She pushes the body of the desk. You notice that this one is dressed more richly. Probably dressed to look like a minor nobleman, someone who might frequent a bookshop...

##### Talissa
* Female elf 
  * Strangely calm for someone who has apparently killed several people
  * Wearing an elegant dress that shimmers in what sunlight gets through the blinds
