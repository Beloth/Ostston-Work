## Next Session - 13th Dec 2018

### Last Session

The party started in a small underwater cave which had a bricked up exit with a small hole at the bottom that was allowing a small stream of water flow through into the cave. They decide to break through, opening up a small tunnel which led to a room with 2 exits. One was blocked up in a similar manner to the previous one. As they investigated the room a ghostly knight appeared which upon seeing Kairon challenged they. Branton sees the crest on the knight shield and recognised part of it as the symbol of Torn. The crest as a whole sparked a bit of recognition but in the heat of the moment he could not place it. The knight also saw that Branton was a follower of Torn and relaxes his stance. He explained the a devilish cult had invaded this place and had bound him to a stone lying in the corner. If they take the stone to his resting place he will give them information on how to get to the Seal room which seemed to be of interest to the cult

They agree and leave through the second door. They find the room which the knight described to then that holds 3 skeletons. 2 of which seemed to be of knights as they have the remains of plate armour. As they approach the ghostly knight approaches the third body and as it does so changes it appearance to a much smaller and younger person, a squire. It tells the party of a secret entrance to  the Seal room, however they need to find the key.

Exploring further the party finds another room which contained a diary which provides some further information of what occurred here.

Diary Entries

1
We've gathered the non-combatants and a couple of the injured knights and sealed the floor. The high priest has activated the wards. Nothing should be able to get through and only he can deavitate them. We are safe 
Some fiends managed to sneak passed before the wards went up. Sir Kenath gave his life protecting the children. Ser Jenny was further injured preventing then from reaching Mielikki's Seal. We've bandaged her wounds but wit limited supplies we couldn't clean it properly 
Its been a number of days since the wards went up and no hint that the attack has been beaten off... 
2
My suspicions were well founded. While everyone else slept I went to look where the bodies were being kept. Chunks of flesh have been removed. I think... I think we've been eating them... what are we becoming... 
I can bear it no longer. We have become feral animals. Eating our dead. Something must be done... 
To my shame I have killed those I swore to protect. To anyone reading this, I confess I poisoned the remaining water with a sleeping draught and killed them while they slept. I fear I will never see Mielikki's light but to allow them to degenerate further into cannibalism would be unthinkable. The same dagger that ended their lives will end mine. 
3
I've inspected the seal and cross referenced it with the designs and noticed that there are difference. Extra runes here and there. 
The runes are in Infernal and unfortunately no one here can read them. So I'll never know what they were trying to do. But at least we stopped them. 
Sir Jenny's wounds have become infected. She's dying and there is nothing I can do about it. What little medicine we have can not cure it so I have administered some sleeping draught to help ease the pain. 
4
The children are too weak now. They can barely move. Petro believes that we should give up on them and that their rations would help the adults survive until the tunnel is complete. He was shouted down. 
Petro attempted to kill Lena thinking that we would believe she had died of hunger. Wenal went into a frenzy and has badly injured Petro. 
We've had another rat stew. I'm grateful but its curious. I've not seen any rats around.... 
Petro's has died of his wounds. He wasn't a bad man but I can find little sympathy for him. 
I think its been a 2 weeks but its hard to tell when there's no light. 
  
They continue on and find the room which the ghost told them held the secret entrance. Its hidden behind a mural of a forest scene. The missing key appears to be a missing part of the mural where there is a circle hole which would be the head of a 4 legged animal.

They continue to search for this key coming upon what appears to be a storage area. Branton takes the lead and enters the room look at the crates followed by Ahsoka and Ogden. As Branton bends down to inspect the crates, Ogden and Ahsoka look up to see a black mass practically fall on top of Branton. A sizzling can be heard as acid eats into Branton's armour. The Black pudding attacks and as the party defends itself from ranged where possible to avoid the acidic splash back. Branton's slashing attack force the pudding to split several times before he succumbs. Ahsoka's attempt to attack from range ends up with Yojimbo taking a throwing star into his side. 

After defeating the pudding they found 2 medallions along with some other treasure. One appears to be the missing part of the mural and the other emanates a magic aura and is given to Eniaris for the time being. Back at the mural, Kairon places the other medallion on the mural and two centaurs charge out of the mural attacking the party. After defeating them they notice that the eyes in the medallion can be changed to different colours. They were green so they change them to blue and place it again against the mural. This time the door is revealed. 

From there they can see into the Seal room where several cultists are passing supplies through what appears to be a tear in space above a runic seal, while a tiefling and some sort of devil looks on. There appears to be a female magic user in some sort of bubble who is holding the tear open. Believing the odds were against them they party head back to the entrance to tear down the other blocked door. 

As Branton starts to make a hole a spear is suddenly thrust through, injuring him. After several attempts to continue to take the blockage down. Kairon sends his familiar as a spider through to see who is attacking through the holes they make. There appears to be 6 or more devils laying in wait for them. 

They decide that maybe that was too many for them to take on so attempt to block the way up again before heading back to the secret entrance to the Seal room where they now just see the tiefling, devil and magic user. Thinking they could take them, Branton charges in only to see several cultist they were working in the corner and out of sight. A battle ensues and while the cultists are taken down with ease the tiefling and devil are more difficult foes and several of the party fall unconscious. Ogden seems to be singled out as the healer and the magic user doesn't seem to be able to aid her allies as she is concentrating on something else. 

When the tiefling seemed about to fall he disengages and heads back to the magic user, taking a box that was on a plinth leaps into the tear. The magic user dissipates the bubble throwing the party to the ground. She casts some sort of spell on the seal before disappearing. As the party starts to investigate the room the seal lights up and a blast of energy shoots up cracking the ceiling, which begins to fall, water coming through. Continuing to search the room Kairon finds a rod on one of the cultists before the ceiling collapses and water rushes in. 

The party run back the way they came, barrelling through and killing two spine devils that seemed surprised to see and charging dwarf running straight at them. They eventually make it to the first room they entered through.

### Ironhills
#### Description
A very large village verging on a small town nestled between multiple hills in which appears the only flat peice of land around. To the north is the mountain range that denotes the border of Hestal and to the East is Blackpine Forrest. Watch towers on the tops of the surrounding hills prove some protecting or warning from harm. Mostly wooden buildings with a few more substantial stone based buildings in the centre. A well made central road runs through the centre heading south towards Ostston. Large warehouses dominate the sides of this road. Deep rut have formed showing how well used and heavy the goods are. Empty wagons are lined up by the warehouses. Several foundries can be seen belching out thick smoke as they smelt the various ores that came from the mines to the north.

#### Government
* Governer appointed by Rulers of Ostston
  * Kettering - Human male. Later 50's balding. Clothes are obviously finer than the average population of Ironhills but nothing compared to those of the Ostston
* Major eleccted by locals
  * Dain - Dwarven male. Blacksmith. Very down to earth
  
#### Guards 
Usually relatively low guard presense, but recently more have arrive due to loses of caravans

#### Guilds
Heavy mining and blacksmith presence. Large mercenary compliment used to guard caravans and warehouse. Also used as town protection.

### Party escort
* A guard company has arrive to escort the party back to Ostston.

* About 25 men in total
* Several mages/apprentices have been sent to set up a teleportation circle. Led by Mage Stiren, half-elf male, Wizard.
  * Won't be ready for a couple of weeks but will allow Archanist Shanirra to teleport people here when required

#### Major Tharin
Looks tired, has a fresh wound on his face, just missed his eye. Starting to scar over. Sitting at a table in the corner nursing a drink.  
*The cult uprising was larger than anyone expected. Hundreds dead. Eventually we won back the streets. We were luck that Lord Tanafrey's men help otherwise we may have been overrun. However as soon as it was put down the search for a scapegoat began and the city guard and High Marshal Felarn bore the brunt of it. Last I heard he has been relived of his duties pending an investigation*    

*Most of the top leadership of the guard is also under investigation. I was cleared on the word of the Archanist Shanierra but was told in no uncertain terms it would be better for my health if I left the city for a while. So here I am overseeing an increased guard for Ironhills*  

*The guard itself has been stood down from active duty. The city guard at least. Those outside continue but they are taking orders from... gods knows who now.*  

*Martial law was in place when we left with Tanafrey's men taking charge while they work out who in the city guard can be trusted*  

*An escort has also been arranged for your trip back to Ostston. Shanierra said you have more information about the cultists and their goals? Is there anything you can tell me that might help?*  

* Escort available staight away and can lend you 4 horses for the journey. 2 mounted guards. 2 days if rushed otherwise 3 days
* Escort available in 2 days with a caravan (4 wagons), lend you 4 horses but will travel at the speed of the caravan. 6 guards (2 mounted) 7 days travel. Will be taking iron, copper, tin, etc ingots to Ostston. Will pay them 100gp + 100gp danger pay per encounter.

## Back in Ostston
### Description
As you approach the entrance to the city you notice that while the number of people entering and leaving is much reduced the time taken to search them has increased with due to the guards being more through. The amount of guards has also doubled but are mainly dominated by those wearing the crest of the Tanafrey's. There are the odd city guard here and there.

As you enter the city proper you can see the damage caused by the attack. There are several burnt out buildings and many more showing various amounts of damage, smashed windows, broken doors. It also looks like several places have been looted, possibly by unscrupulous people taking advantage of the chaos.

The number of people out has also decreased, but they all keep their heads down not making eye contact with you or any others, quickly going about there business. Almost every street corner has a pair of guards fully armed. 

### Archanist Shanirra
#### Description
The Archanist looks tired. her clothing rumpled as if she hasn't changed in a number of days. The heavy bags under her eyes and meesy hair also indicates her lack of sleep. She attempts a small smile in your direction which comes out more like a grimace.

*So what did you find out in the forest?* 

*I've been trying to keep order in the city but without Marshall Felarn and the city guard its been a struggle. Lord Tanafrey has been a god send. With his help we managed to contain the cultist but not without cost. We lost maybe 60 city guardsman, with another 100 or so injured. You've probably seen the damage to the city. What's worst is the fear that has enveloped the city. People don't know who to trust anymore. Since then there have been protests which have had to be forcfully put down. Marshal Felarn has been made a scapegoat and has been place under house arrest pending an investigation.*

*For now I don't have the resources to continue to investigate the goings on with the cult unless you have a solid lead of what their goals are*

### Goals
* Help Marshal Felarn clear his name
* Investigate the cult more fully
  * Head to the temple of Meleikki to investigate
  * Kairon's patron gives him a lead
* Branton learns of the Order of the Righteous Gods

## Kairon's Dream
You find yourself I a enormous room dominated at the far end by an immense figure sitting behind an equally large table. There seems to be hundreds of people your size almost floating towards it. When you take a closer look they arn't all people, but a mixture of people of all races and just as many devils and fiends all facing the figure at the end. You feel a tug and you find yourself joining the flow of people.*    

Its strange.. as you move closer, rather that getting bigger, the figure seems to shrink until it is maybe the size of a giant by the time you are in front of it. Its wearing a robe that covers most of its features but you spot small protrusions emerging from the hood and notice the red skin of a Tiefling, if Tieflings grew to giant size that is. It  appears to be writing on some parchment with a quill. Its aura surrounds you and recognise it as your patron despite of what it looks like.  

What have you found out about Malachar's cultists?  

As you describe what you've found his aura becomes more and more oppressive until you can barely force the words out. He lets out a roar of anger and for a brief second the illusion around him flickers and you get to see his true form for a second...  

It took much of our resources on this plane the last time he made a play for the Heart of Mielikki and we are only just getting to the same stage. You will stop them from getting the Heart of Mielikki at all costs. Malachar must not be allowed to corrupt it or he will make a play to retake his former holdings.
