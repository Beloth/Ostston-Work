## Session 2 - 17th October 2017

## Description

While waiting for Ashoka and Yojimbo to return, Branton was approach by a messanger from the temple of Torn who tolds him that there was a druid waiting for him back at the temple with a message from Captain Jardon. The party headed back to the temple where they find the druid Eniaris who explained that he was willing to help the party in their investigations in order to help convice the guard to send aid to the Druids in Blackpine.

The party heads to their only lead back at the warehouse where they attempt to persuade the merchant guards and then the owner of the warehouse to allow them access. Yojimbo attempts to destract them but setting off a noise at the back of the ware hosue. However this only make a the owner an 2 of the gurads to return to the warehouse with the rest remaining and denying the party access. So the party decides to wonder around the warehouse to see if they can find another way in. They do find a back enterance which is also guarded. 

Thwarted the party headed to a local tavern where they sit down for a meal and a drink. Enaris approched the bar and asked the barkeeper whether any of the warehouse workers were here. One is pointed out to him and Yojimbo decides to approch him while he is dicing with his friends. After a brief discussion he attempts to get the worker drunk by spiking a beer with a more potent spirit. However taking the 1st sip of the drink the worker decides there is something off about the drink and sets it aside. Once the dice game ends the worker, and many more of the partrons of the tavern, leave. By the time the party reaches the exit the worker is indistinguishable from the rest and the party is forced to return to their meal.

Heading back to the warehouse in the dark, Branton attempts to suss out the patrol pattern of the nightwatchman. Ashoka uses that pattern to climb up to the top of the warehouse and peers in via the skylight. The rest of the party attempts to hide from the returning watchmen but fails spectacularly and is spotted. The watchman reaches for his weapon and takes out a whistle while demanding what they are there for. Unfortunately this spooks Kairon who launched a spell at the watchman who blows his whistle attracting more for the guard to their location. Branton manages to defuse the situaton and the party minus Ashoka moves away.

Once the watchmen returns to the warehouse Ashoka signalled the rest of the party back and they made their work to the rear enterance. As none had the skills to pick the lock, Branton used a crowbar to force the back door open and the party made their way inside. The watchmen confronts them and with a cry of "For Malachar" attacks. The party easily dispatches them and they find tatoos on them, They then investigate the warehouse and found tracks indicating a regularly moved crate and Branton moves it aside to find a trap door. Once again they rely on Branton's strength to break open the door revealing stairs down.

They followed the stairs down to the sewers and into a cave system, where they were ambushed by a pair of Oozes who's attacks ate away at the weapons and armour of those who attack in melee. After defeating them they hear chanting coming from one of the passage way and go to investigate with Ogden leading the way. They find another cavern with a large arcway to the rear, a stone altar in the middle and 2 large glowing orbs between them. Also present were several cultists, a magic welding Tiefling and a rogue like human, all of whom attack the party. The cultists are easily defeated but the Tiefling and Rogue appear to be protected by the magic of the orbs and lauch a viscous attack against the party. In an attempt to circumvent the protection Kairon launches a magical attack at the orbs which had a visible affect. The rest of the party see this and attempt to follow suit with mundane attacks to lesser effect. The rogue seeing that the odds are against them leaves through the portal with the Tiefling follwoing, but not before lauching her own magic attack on the orbs. 

That attack destablises the magic so much that it causes the ground to start rumbling. The party quick realise that they eed to leave but the ground shakes so much that several of them fall to the ground. The shaking of the ground gets worse and worse as the orb releases the pent up magic and eventually explodes knocking Eniaris unconscious. Luckily Ogden was still in the cavern having been knocked to the ground, it heal him while the rest of the psrty had run away. They eventually make it back up to the surface where they decide to rest for the rest of the night either at the temple or an inn.
