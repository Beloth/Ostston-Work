## Session 2 - 20th June 2017

### Summary

The party meets with an elven druid helping heal the wounded at Wayfair Inn. There they are approached by Sargent Koby asking them to deliever a letter to Captain Jardon in Highcastle warning him of the raids on Wayfair Inn. They agree for a fee of 100gp
As they are about to leave, a merchant asks if he could join them with his wagon. Slaanesh negotiates a fee of 100gp and food for the trip. 

The first day passes without incident and they set camp for the night. Their watch fails to notice an wolf pack appraoching and they gain the surprise. The pack, made up of 5 wolves manages to render 2 of the party unconcious before being defeated with the bard sleeping through most of the fight. Sariel notices that the merchant stayed hidden under the wagon but had a wand out.

The 2nd day the party notices a tree trunk blocking part of the road. Wolf and Slaanesh scout out ahead of the party but were ambushed by some tribemen. They fled back towards the rest of the party who all ran forward accept for Sariel who stayed back with the merchant. The fight was brutal with 3 members of the party falling unconcious including Sariel who took a swing at the merchant, thinking that he was apart of the ambush, failed and had her simitar stuck in the wood of the wagon. The merchant, in retaliation opened fire with his wand of magic missiles, striking Sariel 3 times and knocking her unconcious. Gianek discussed the stuation with the merchant and found Sariel at fault and the party continued on.

As they reached Highcastle they split with the merchant who handed over a pouch of money. Later they realised that the pouch only contained 75gp. The party split up with Slaanesh and Wolf looking for a tailer to make a cloak from the wolf pelts they had collected. The rest headed to the keep to meet with Captain Jardon. They are paid the agreed amount and asked to return the next day for the possibility of more work.

The next day Captain Jardon offers them 25gp each and access to the guards supplies, to go find the missing scouts that had been sent North East. He showed them the rendezvous point. They party headed off.

During the 1st night the watch spots moving heading NE. They attempt to follow but are spotted and a quick ambush was set up to slow them down. After firing several arrows at the party the ambushers melt into the night having successful stopped the party from following them.

## Highcastle
      
The large central keep dominates the skyline as you approach Highcastle. It is surrounded by tall walls and several towers making it a formidable defensive structure. Its defensive position however has been slightly compromised by the sprawling town that has sprung up around it, giving any attacker cover to approach the walls. At attempt to build a stone wall around the town has been started but currently only consists of a single gate keep and several hundred feet of wall

    * 15+ The Merchants areupset. They have been complaining about the amount of crime in the city. We need to setup up the amount of patrols in the city. We don't have enough men to patrol the city and send patrols East. Both Hillard and Pallen have report then all clear so there is no need to send patrols out.
