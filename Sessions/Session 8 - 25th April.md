## Session 8 - 25th April 2018

## Description

Lord Weester's servant informs the party that he had followed the investigators to the warehouse and waited to see if anything occurred. After a while a group left the warehouse carrying a hidden cargo, He followed this group to an abandoned house just inside the slums. He agreed to take the party to the house. Once there they spent a little time investigating the outside before Branton became bored and kicked in the door. Inside the party found very little of note until they looked around the cellar door where it looked like someone had brushed the dust to erase any tracks.

After a brief check for traps Branton force the door open and the party entered the cellar with Kairon guarding the door. Inside they found a man who turned out to be Investigator Ribel who is unconscious, although Branton believes him dead. As the party continues look around a dagger is thrown at the back of Ahsoka causing more pain than a single dagger should and causing her to freeze up in pain. A figure emerges from under the stairs and brushes aside Kairon and escapes the house.

Looking though several notes left on the table they find that the person was likely the hired torturer who has already passed information onto they employee and was planning of disposing of the body in a house fire. They decide to leave with the now conscious Ribel who directs them to the library and also informs them that Investigator Rusvell is dead but Dalee is alive and has been take to the Black Ore and Timber guild hall.

They return High Marshall Felarn to inform him of their findings and to alert him to a possible magically attack. They also ask for information about the Black Ore and Timber guild. Not being a major guild he asks High Merchant Xavier for more information as a favour. They party learns that it is a relatively new guild formed when the contracts to harvest timber from Blackpine forest where offered up and that their guildhall is actually a converted warehouse near the northern docks.

At the guildhall the party encounters a man with an armful of parchment in what appears to be a study. Entering the room, Branton commands the man to yield causing him to drop the parchment. As Yojimbo bends down to investigate the parchment the man gives him a quick knee to the temple before rushing down what appears to be a secret door, Ogden and Kairon hot on his heels. So quick in fact that Ogden fails to notice that the tunnel ends in a drop which has a rope attach to the ceiling, and he fall straight down and hit the man would is using the rope to climb down. Ogden managed to grab onto the man but is then kicked off for his troubles and lands painfully and winded at the base. 

Kairon managed to spot the rope and use it to climb down, but as the man drops onto the prone Ogden and disappears this causes Kairon to lose his grip and fall on top of Ogden, winding them both. Ahsoka and Branton both spot the rope and begin climbing down. Unfortunately, due to the load on the rope it breaks free causing them both to start to fall, however using the sides of the tunnel they stop themselves from falling too far and attempt to slowing climb down. 

Bring up the rear, Yojimbo finds a study spot and attaches a rope to lower himself down. Recovering, the party follows the tunnel until they come to a small room containing a table, a couple of chairs, one of which has been knocked over) and a closed door on the other side. Branton rushes in only to take several bolts for his trouble. Using several crates as cover there were several thugs defending the room, where the party also sees a tied up female elf infront of a strange orb. The party moves to engage the thugs but failed to spot a female magic user hiding at the back who launches a vicious area attack knocking Ahsoka unconscious.

The party manages to defeat the thugs and the magic users retreats through a door at the back of the room. Dalee, the female elf, urges the party to chase her as there is another room which contains evidence of whatever plot these people are up to. With Kairon in the lead the party sees both the magic user and the man from the study  plus an additional person running out of the evidence room down some further tunnels, but not before they set the room n fire. Rather than chase after them the party attempts to grab as much from the room as possible, getting several messages, a map, some encoded messages and the method by which the messages where encoded (a book).

While most of the party head back with Dalee, Kairon follows the tunnels after the fleeing people but after a while loses all trace of them and returns the way they came. The party takes Dalee to the same place as Ribel, the Ostston Library and then spends some time over the evidence they have gathered.

##### Lord Weester

* Young, early 21's Human male with short dark hair. Glasses. 
* When asked about the the investigators will deny any knowledge of them but will seem very nervous (insight check)
* If pressed will reveal that she was forced to send them on a wild goose chase
  * He is being blackmailed
    * Family's fortune was squandered by her father leaving them on the verge of bankcrupcy. 
    * She is trying to keep them afloat so that they can send his brother to Royal School in Adrana. 
      * Known to Branton. Nobles from around the country sent there. Very presigous
    * Using the families warehouse, no questions asked
  * Doesn't like it but there isn't much she can do. She did have them followed however. 
    * Jools. Male half elf followed them to the warehouse where they were ambushed and knocked unconscious. They were then taken to an empty house in the slums. Didn't leave there.
  
#### Abandon house

* Rather deralict house just inside what is considered the slums. Would be a relatively nice place in its hey day. A fix-a-upper. Ground floor, broken furniture, lots of dust, boarded up windows, etc. Similar on the 1st floor. Door to cellar, perception check, less dust. Signs of someone erasing tracks. high score looks like its been open recently. Heavy latch.

##### Celler 

* Celler door has an alarm spell on it
  * Person opening it Perception check DC18
    * Success - Just as you are reaching for the handle you notice a piece of find silver wire across the gap between the door and the frame.
      * Arcana check DC14+ (As no casters in the party can learn it) 
        * Success - Alarm spell
        * Failed - wire is probably worth at least a silver
    * Fail - As you open the door you stop just as it start to squick you hesitate before slowly opening to to prevent any more noise.

* There is light coming from 2 lanterns in the cellar
* Tied to the chair is a human male. Head down, bare chested. You can see blood, both fresh and dried from wounds all over his chest.
* Several barrels line the walls.
* A table on one side, covered with several bloody tools.
* Human female hiding under the stairs
  * Perception check dc 20 to spot her just as see makes an attack at the person at the back
    * Sneak attack bonus 2d6
    * and bonus to escape
    * If has time will put something heavy on the door.
    
##### Investigator Trent
* Badly beaten. Thin wounds all over his body. Tortured
* Barely conscious, will need time to recover
* Find Dalee.. please to must find Dalee... they took her under the Black Ore & Timber guild hall.
* Rasvull is dead.. they killed him

##### Notes on the table
* Subject: Human male. Magic User. 
* The drug in his system should prevent him from being coherent enough to cast spells but still being able to answer. As an added safeguard I have broken all of his fingers. Even so he has proven to be a tough subject. Seems to have had some training in resisting interrogation but people always break. You just need to know their breaking point and after 2 days he has begun to give answers.
* Unfortunately he doesn't seem to have alot of information that my employee wants. He knew somethings on magical defenses but nothing specific to Ostston's defense. No knowledge of any heartstone, but believed that Shaniera would know if there was any here.
* He was investigating an mystrious cult which had launched an (apparent) attack on the city, but had found very little in terms of evidance. 
* No more useful information to be gain from this subject. I've sent my findings to my employer as requested and will dispose of the body, a nice little house fire should do, before starting leaving to interrogation of the female.

#### Result

* Neither Shaniera or Felarn know anything about this guild. They ask Xavier (The High Merchant)
* The Black Ore & Timber guild is a relative small mining and lumber guild that operates mainly from Blackpine Forrest. 
* It a young guild. Only got its charter within the last year or so when Blackpine forest was opened up for logging.
* Doesn't have a guildhall inside the city walls. Its actually a converted warehouse on the northern edge of the outer city.
* Will need to go through his notes if you need more information about them and would want to know the reason for asking. The merchant guilds are his area of responsibilty after all..
    
### Black Ore & Timber

#### The Guildhall
* From the outside looks like a standard warehouse although were large double doors would have been has been replaced with a smaller door and here seems to be a 2nd floor in place as several windows have been put in.

## Study encounter

Inside the room you see male human, dark hair, patch over 1 eye. Dirty leather armour, sheathed short sword and buckler and his arms full of what appears to be parchment and a ink set. As soon as he sees the party he swears, dumps everything on the ground. If possible he makes a dash to what appears to be a "secret door" that open but would have been part of the wall.

* Party can try to intercept him, he will put up a token fight but will surrender when he gets low on health as he is out numbered. Will not give up his weapons but will give information to be allowed to leave. 
  * Hired to provide some extra muscle. Probably the thieves guild but he didn't exactly ask too many questions.. he needed the coin.
  * There where some people noising around so they setup an ambush. 
  * 2 were killed and the other, a female elf was being held for questioning / as a hostage (points to the secret door)
  * There is a tunnel system under the warehouse that goes under the river. He thinks it was probably used as a sumgglers run. Someone converted cavern underneath. If you are willing to pay I might be able to give you more information....
  
* He will try to inch his way to the door... and given the oppertunity will rush through and he slaps something just inside which causes the door to rapidly shut.
