## Session 7 - 22nd December 2017

## Description

The 4 at the inn come down after a good rest to find the inn busy, the innkeeper hands Yojimbo a note from Talissa given him the final information she has gathered about Seymour. Yojimbo then tries to get information from him about what the inn is so busy. He is told about the earth temor that happened last night which cause alot of damaged and a section of the city to collapse. He also is surprised that the party hadn't felt it. The 4 decide to head to the temple to meet up with the other 2 before heading to help with the aftermath.

The 2 in the temple find it almost deserted as most are out helping with the injured. They wait for the rest of the party before heading to help. They find where the wounded are being sent to and spot healer from around the city giving aid. Branton attempts for help a man with a broken leg whilst searching him for the mark of Malachar. In doing so he is rather rather with him and caused him to cry out multiple times. A senior cleric rushes across to see what is happening and Branton wisely decides to leave the triaging to the others. Those that are capable start helping with other injured and Yojimbo trys to question the one he is helping with little success.

Branton then tried to talk to one of the guards that seem to be directing the others. Yojimbo used message to try to direct the conversation but unfortunately Branton doesn't realise its him and begins to think his god is talking to him. The guard suggests that they head back to the keep and report back to Captain Jardon.

They do so and are lead into what appears to be the Marshal's office where Jardon and alot of others seem to be in the process of organising the response to the tragedy. Branton describes what the party did in the cavern, gets carried away and kind of implies that they may have been responsible in some small way for the disaster. Marshal Waylynn immediatedely calls for their arrest and lays the blame solely on them. Captain Jardon tells them not to resist and they lay down their weapons. They are striped of all equipment and sent to the cells. A bit later Branton is allowed to a released under house arrest as long as he gives an oath not to leave.

During the night Jardon fetches Branton and leads him back to the cells where he frees the rest of the party, giving them back their equipment and tells them about his worries over the Marshal's loyalities. He asks them to investigate this before leaveing for Ostston and reporting to Major Tharin. He tells them of the 2 properties here in Highcastle and the estate on the outskirts. The party decides to head to his main residances that should be empty.

They search the places finding a main study on the ground floor, where they come across a large tapastry that concealed a wall safe. With none able to pick a lock, Branton attempts to force it open triggering a poison needle trap. Within the safe they find a bag of 50 gold, a pouch of 7 gems, 1 healing potion and a ledger. The ledger contain information on the household expenses.

On the upper floor they find a smaller private study where Eniaris finds a half completed letter to Lord and Lady Batovian (Branton's parents), claiming a friendship with him.

Not wanting to risk the Mistress house still the Marshal was there, the party head to an inn to wait till dawn and the opening of the city gates. Moving in pairs they eventually make it out of the city and head to the estate. They decided to camp by the main road until its dark. While waiting Kairon identifies his familiar, and Imp which Yojimbo decides to name Germimia. They use it to scout out the Country house.

Ashoka sneaks up to the house with the objective of climbing up to an unlocked window. Unfortunately Yojimbo attempts to follow and isn't as sneaky has he thought he was, attracting a patrol. Ashoka darted to the house and managed to find a hiding place while Yojimbo drops to the floors and uses minor illusion to try to distract the guard away from him, eventually successfully.

Ashoka makes it into the house and starts exploring, trying to find a way to let the others in. Unfortunately the plan to open the back door from the kitchen is ruined when it appears that the kitchen is occupied. Becoming more and more stressed as time goes on without abling to find an enterance, Ashoka's luck finally runs out as is confronted by a pair of guards. She attempts to make a run for it but is eventually cornered and taken prisoner. The guard announce that they will call for the magistrate in the morning.



#### At the inn.

When they come down for breakfast the innkeeper approaches Yojimbo. 

"A dwarf come round in the early morning with a note for you"

See https://github.com/Beloth/Ostston-Work/blob/master/Characters/Yojimbo-Woz/Talissa's-note.md
* Perception check DC 12
  * Notice that there are several groups excitedly gossiping amongst themselves. 
  * Talking about the great earth temor that happened last night and the damage caused by it
    * 1 such group consists of 4 city guards whose uniform is all dirty and torn. They have just finished their shift of digging out surviors from the collapsed areas.
    * Mainly the poorer areas affected due to the unstudiness of the buildings but also the business / warehouse districts affect.
    * Some talk of the gods being angry
    
#### Outside

* People rushing about more
* Heavier than normal guard presence

#### At the keep

The group are shown to an office by 2 guards, not Captain Jardon's but Marshal Weylynn's. Both the Marshal, Captain and what appears to be a aide are waiting for them. 

##### Office
Description  
Much large and more opulant office to the Captain's A large intricately decorated desk dominates one side of the room at which the Marshall sits reading some papers and making notes. The Captain and a aide are standing by a wall which has a large map of the city on it and passing out orders to the various guards / clerks that are attending. The captain is pointing to the map as the aide (Inaral) takes notes.

Jardon - "I take it you have some news?"

While the party is reporting to Jardon, the Marshal appears to be concentrating on his own business and not paying them any attention

If the party mentions the being at the centre of the earth tremor, the Marshal will interupt.
"Are you saying you caused the tremor? GUARDS!!! Arrest them!"

The 2 guards move forward as does the aide. 2 more guards enter from an other door. 

"Do you know how many people died last night because of your actions?"
Taking a closer look you notice for the 1st time how tired both the captain and the marshal look. 
"That tremor caused a whole residental area to collapse. Tens, maybe hundreds dead or injured! Take them to the cells"

If the party seems like they will fight, Jardon will reason with them. Else 4 level 2 guards, 1 level 5 Captain, 1 level 3 aide. They will render them unconcious

#### Prison cell

Party is stripped of all posessions and taken to individual cells.

That night Captain Jardon head down to the cells acompanied by the same aide, both carrying bundles of the party equipment. 
Dropping the bundles by the door the aide (Inaral) exits saying "I'll keep watch"

Captain Jardon
"There is something not right with the Marshal. He is unwilling to hear anything about this cult and I suspect he maybe in league with them as several of his decisions seem to favour them. Inaral here will take to through a secret passage way that will see you out of the keep. From there I need you to find evidence implicating him and take it to Major Tharin In Ostston. He's an old friend of mine and will be able to get you in to see the High Marshall. Here's an introductory letter detailing my concerns.

As well as quarters in the castle, the Marshal has 2 properties in the city and his estate on the outskirts. His main residance is in the nobles quarter. Luckily his wife is currently visiting relatives in Adianna so it should be relatively empty. He also has a townhouse where he keeps his mistress, which is probably where he is now.

His estate is just north of the city. There a small wood the you could use to sneak closer to the manor but be warned the estate is patrolled by city guard.

The Inaral rushes in... "there's someone coming down the stairs."
Jardon "Finish up here, I'll send them away"
The aide continues to unlook the doors

Perception check 10+
You hear Jardon talking to someone..
"What are you doing here? Wait who are you?"

Hear a struggle, a gasp of pain and a body hitting the ground. You see a Jardon on the ground with 2 people standing over him with knives out. As you enter they turn towards you....

2 level 2 Assassins. - 700xp

1 injured by Jardon
Inaral attacks the uninjured 1

* If search the bodies (Investigation dc 10) find tatoos of the Malachar symbol.
  * Jardon "This is not good... if they managed to get this deep into the castle without being detected...." He exchanges looks with Inaral... "It means that someone in the guard has been helping them... beyond the Marshal"

### Secret Passage way
The aide - Inaral leads the party deeper into the basement, into what appears to be a storeroom containing many barrels (beer). "Help me move this one" After moving the barrel he putshis fingers on the wall in an awkward position, you hear a click and he pushes against the wall openig up a passage. 

The passage is dark and damp but leads you to what appears to be a dead end but once again he places his hand in a awkward position and slides a small door open. Only Askoha can fit through easily, the rest have to crawl although its an easier fit for Ogden than the rest. You have to push through a rather thick hedge inorder to get free.

* Furniture appears to be covered with dust sheets
* In the private study
  * One wall lots of bookcases filled with an impressive number of books. A closer look shows that the books have been looked after very well, almost as if they had never been touched and quite a number of them would probably be worth quite alot.
  * One wall dominated by a large tapestry, decipting a man dressed in plate armour in an heroic pose sitting upon a rearing horse. A closer look shows that the man has a very familiar face, the Marshal's
    * Branton make a history check. This is a reproduction of a very old and famous tapestry which is currently on display in the royal palace in Adrana. Most have been costly to make
    * Investigation check dc 14+ to find a hidden panel on the wall, behind the tapastry revealing a lock wall safe.
      * You notice that the tapastry appears to be hung from a rail to make it easy to move to one side.

      * Contains a bag of 50gp and a pouch of 7 gems (int check dc 14 to determine value. 50gp each). Ledger. (Investigation check dc 10, appears to be the household expense. If 15+ something strange... need someone more knowledgable in accounting)
        * Numbers don't seem to add up. The balance seems to be much greater than it should be considering the amount coming in and out

    * She is strangely confident for a lone half elf alone with a party of 6...

* Guards will try to arrest them

#### Sewer way - Thieves Underground

* Yojimbo will know of ways out of the city using the sewers but these areas are known as the thieves underground and while he hasn't necessarily been barred from using them he has been denied help and the protection from the league, so could be dangerous.
  * Use the sewers
    * Several bands of thieves pass you by. Yojimbo gives a subtle hand gesture which indicates that you belong here and which they return.
    * Come across a group of 4 people, 1 male gnome, 3 humans (2 male 1 female), are checking another band as they pass through.
      * Yojimbo knows that this is the way the league checks up on a member haul. Random inspection on the way back in. Means the group is lead by a trusted member of the league
    * Yojimbo perception check - pass recognises the gnome as Alton. He is a respected member of the league and one that is likely to know about his situation and would unlikely allow he to pass unchallanged. 
    * If you can't talk your way through they will fight.
      * Thieves Underground encounter
      * 1 rogue gnome
      * 3 human thugs
