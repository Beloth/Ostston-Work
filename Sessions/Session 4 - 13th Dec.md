## Session 4 - 13th December 2017

## Description


After being captured Ashoka is taken to what appears to be a store room where she was tied to a chair and a servant left to keep an eye out on her. The rest of the party decide that something must have gone wrong as they have not heard from her in a while. A plan is made for Eniaris to cause a distraction by releasing the horses from the stables. However on the way to the stables he is seen by a couple of guards which causes him to double back to the rest of the party, where Branton takes the lead and manages to convince them that he is a noble whose squire (Eniaris) managed to lose his horse. He also gets them to escort the party to the house where he convinces the butler to allow them quarters until the next day when the mistress of the house can made a decision.

During the night Kairon sends his familiar who can turn invisible, to try and find Ashoka. After investigating several rooms it find Ashoka who in the mean time had managed to free herself from her bonds while the servant slept. She had then knocked out the servant and tied him to the chair. After reuniting with the rest of the party it is decided that she should hide in the forest while the rest of the party take to the mistress of the house in the morning.

The next morning Branton is take for an audience with Lady Elise,and Ogden tags along as one of his servants. After a few drinks Lady Elise is willing to allow Branton to search Marshal Waylynn's study if he takes care of a problem for her, her husband Lord Greynoot. Ogden attemptted to say something which causes Lady Elise surprise that Branton would allow his servants to talk out of turn. Branton attempting to recover slaps Ogden into silence and leaves to discuss with the rest of the party before agreeing.

The party agrees and take Lord Greynoot on a hunt. As the hunting party splits up, Branton leads Lord Greynoot  away and once along knocks him off his horse. Making sure he just unconcious he hides him under various branches and leaves. Not knowing what to do next Branton just stands there until Eniaris eventually arrives. He convinces Branton that there is a dangerous bear in the forest somewhere that might take care of Greynoot. Not quite understanding, Branton is distracted by a hunting horn and takes off for the kill. Eniaris then druid shapes into a bear and takes care of Lord Greynoot.

Returning to the mansion the party is given an hour to search the study. They find a hidden door behind a bookcase which appears to be locked by a mystical puzzle. They attempted to solve the puzzle but failed to do so  causing the door to be sealed. They then found a trapdoor under a rug and triggered the trap stunning many of them and disorientating the rest. Under the trap door they found a chest containing several papers.  They contain information about bribes about merchants getting more patrols at certain times, less searches on cargo, 3rd sons being given positions of power within the guard, the League of Shadows getting patrol roots moved, etc. One particular paper shows that a patrol route has recently been moved to avoid a ruined guard tower a couple of days away. The party decide that this is worth investigating.

Moving offroad towards the ruins the party see a guard messenger riding quickly towards Ostston but by the time they decide whether or not they should intercept her, she has moved out of range. Some time later another guard group passes them as they hide. This group appears to be a search party.

The next day a storm picks up and the party rushes to the ruins to seek cover. There they stumble over several bodies and as they approach a trapdoor they are attacked by a gargoyle. Defeating it Ashoka notices that there is some magic on the trapdoor linking it to the Gargoyle.

Heading down the stairs that were revealed by opening the trapdoor, Branton enters what appears to be an armoury. Once the party enters they are attacked by a pair of animated armours and a flying sword. During the fight Odgen is knocked unconscious but the party wins the fight and finds that while the magic animating the sword has been broken it is still a fine magic sword.
