## Session 10 - 27th June 2018

## Description

The party returned to Ostston, reaching there just as the gates were being closed for the night. They tried to persuade the Guards to let them through but were unsuccessful until they offer a small amount of coin. Entering the city, they headed to the Order of the Anvil for the night only to be told that they were full due to a number of adventuring parties returning. They were directed to a nearby inn. On their way the noticed that they were being tailed but could not react before being ambushed.

Four assassins attacked the party and managed to knock several of them unconscious. Things were looking serious when a small female halfling fell from the sky, daggers out, right on top of one of the assassins, killing him. After the fight finished she searched the bodies and showed the party a contract she found describing the party and offering a reward for their deaths and a bonus for wiping out the whole party. Another note found had an additional bonus for Yojimbo death signed with an S. 

She told the party that she was hired by some friends to keep an eye out on the party and protect them from this first attack. Yojimbo tried to subtly find out if she was part of the League of Shadows using Thieves Cant, but he didn't pick up on any reply she may have made. As she was about to leave the party pressed for more information but all they got was that she frequents a tavern nearby called the Crooked Nook, that caters for the smaller members of society. She leaves with a huge smile on her face and a jaunty skip in her step.

At the inn, Yojimbo goes into a bit of detail about who he thinks S is and the reason why he would be trying to kill him. The next morning the party head back to the Order of the Anvil, receiving their fee of 400gp for completing the contract. While there they find a number of other contracts that might interest them, clearing a Swamp, killing Ogres and a missing farmers daughter to find. Before they can decide which to start with, a messenger from High Marshal Farlen arrives asking them to meet him in his office.

Once there they are handed another pouch of gold for their previous recovery of the Sage's investigators. The Marshal then tells them that Arcanist Shaniera has found the location of the portal. She believes in to in or under the temple to Meilikki. The Marshal wants the party to investigate discretely. While the party agrees they then bring up the possibility of a reward. The Marshal isn't too impressed with this as he was believing they want to act on behalf of the city. He is even less impressed when as part of the discussion he finds out that a guardsman accepted a bribe to let them into the city at night.

The party then headed to the temple of Meilikki where they in the centre a huge, divinely grown Oak tree. Ahsoka attempts to meditate next to the tree but receives a pain at the back of neck for her trouble. The party manages to gain an audience with the High Priest. They try to gain information from him and notice during the conversation that he has a strangely blank look on his face and there is a delay to each of his answers. As they probe more the two guards at the back of the room draw their bows. 

Fearing an attack, the party readies themselves and Kairon cast hex on the nearest guard. Believing that was an aggressive action the guards attack. During the fight the party notices a thin collar around the neck of the priest, almost hidden by his clothes. Believing it might be controlling him they attempt to remove it but were unsuccessful until they knock him unconscious. Healing him, he tells the party of a group from the Sages of Arcane who dominated him and wanted information on the Vault that lay underneath the temple.

As more of the temple guardians approach Kairon uses the summoning stone from the Arcanist to bring her to the temple. After a brief discussion it was decided that the Archanist would attempt to hold off any of the cultists while the High Priest takes the party to the hidden entrance to the vault beneath the temple. The entrance happens to be under the roots of the Oak tree where there are several guards.

The High priests calls on those loyal to Meilikki to aid him and 2 of the guards do so making it an easy fight. He then proceeds to pull on the horn of the unicorn statue opening up the entrance.

### The Crooked Nook
Eve before you see the enterance you can hear the music and laughter coming from the small building. The door is about 2/3 the size of a normal door. The building is an odd shape. It appears to have been added the corner where 2 streets meet at an odd angle.

All the Medium size players have to duck inorder to enter. Very cramped inside - image Gandalf entering the hobit hole for the 1st time. Inside there is a lively tavern filled with halflins, gnomes and the odd dwarf or 2. There is a band in the corner playing a lively folk tune, the people are all having a good time, the drinks are flowing and meals being eaten.

At the bar there is a male halfling (Bilbus) serving the drinks and chatting with the customers
"What do we have here... we don't see many big'uns in here, well, welcome, welcome.. what can I get yea...." 
* No one want this corner plot so he got it for a steal. Set up this bar to cater for the smaller folk that often get overlooked.
* If you ask to speak to Myra. "Aye, she comes here quite often. Grab a table and I'll send her your way when she gets here"
* Passive perception 15 - notice him talking to a youngish halfling who rushes out the back.
* People are keeping an eye on you... more out of curiosity.. not used to bigger people in their tavern.

#### Myra

She see you, nods her head but heads to the bar 1st. Bilbus hugs her hands her a mug and she makes her way over.

* Not in the thieves guild per se, but she has contacts with them and has learnt odds and ends, a little Thieves Cant and wanted to see if any of you recognised it. 
* She was unsure why they would want to protect you. Especially if it puts them against Th Silent Death (assassin's guild)
* So who are you?
* Can she put you in contact with the League of Shadows.
  * What's in it for her?
  * Give her a couple of days. Doesn't want to burn her own contacts if they don't want to talk to you

### Return to the High Marshal

* Report the attempt to the High Marshal
  * He will suggest that they lay low for a couple of days to let the heat cool off. This will give them more time to finish their side of the investigation.
  * Maybe take a few contracts with the Anvil to get their standing up
  * Hands them a bag containing 600gp
  
#### Find the Portal Site
* Shaniera was being followed while she toured the magical defensive sites but no attack made.
* Found that the portal is in a surprising place is in or under the temple to Mielikki (Goddess of forests, forest creatures, rangers, dryads, autumn).
* Need to find out whether the priesthood of Mielikki are involved or its being hidden from them.
* Cannot risk upsetting the religious by having the city guard search or tip their hand.
* Need the party to discretely investigate.

### Temple of Mielikki
#### Description of Mielikki

Mielikki (pronounced my-LEE-kee), also referred to as the Forest Queen, was the neutral good goddess of autumn, druids, dryads, forests, forest creatures and rangers. Her symbol was a gold-horned, blue-eyed, unicorn's head facing left 

The members of Mielikki’s church are widespread and rarely collect into large groups for any length of time. There are few temples to the Forest Queen; most worship takes place in glades or at small shrines. Temples always include a small stand of trees if not actually constructed in a grove. Most have at least one oak, which serves as both altar and the home of a dryad. Small forest creatures are always welcome within such houses of worship, and many reside therein year-round.

* Like a Roman courtyard, building surrounding an open space with a Large Oak tree in the centre. Has a cerimonial altar in front of it
  * Relatively small temple as worshippers tend to be in more wildeness areas and not urban.
  * Guarded by rangers

* Priest/priestess seem friendly enough and will answer some questions but a perception check DC15, glassy eyed. Almost absentminded.

#### High Priest Aimar Cracan
* High Priest Aimar Cracan, Eldarly Male Elf
  * Being controlled by a slave collar.
  * Enventually he will call the guards to attack
    * Temple of Mielikki Encounter - Map1
  * Arcana check to remove the collar
    * `>` 10 - the collar can just be cut off - Both the cutter and the priest take 2d6 lightning damage from the feedback of the runes being destoryed
    * 10 to 15 - Can be cut off but must insulate both the person cutting and the priest. Will take 1d4 if insulated or 2d6 if not. Dispel magic (level 5 or greater)
    * 15+ - Inspecting the runes you spot a weak point that could be used to disable the collar but will take time. 10-20mins. Else see above
    * Crit Success - Spot a shatter point. Tell everyone to look away. Strike at the shatter point and in a flash of light and heat the collar shatters. The priest takes 1 point of fire damage. Or see above
  * After removed must move quickly, they often check that I am still under their control as the collar was not perfect.
  * They made me replace some of the rangers with their own people, but not all
  * Priest was given instructions  
    * Tolded to encourage clergy to go on pilgrimages and reduce number of people at the temple to a minimum

    * Was asked about the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was at the heart of Blackpine forest

    * I was approached by someone impersonating an imperial historian. They wanted information on the legend of the Temple of Mielikki that was said to have been built in the centre of Blackpine forest.
    * Blackpine forest info  
      * It was said that a grand temple was built there. A huge place where worshippers of Mielikki would go as a pilgrimage. 
      * It was there that the Heart of Mielikki was stored.
      * There was a corruption. No one knows what type. But the temple was ripped from this plane leaving the lake that is now at the centre of Blackpine.
    * Ostston temple info
      * There was a cave system under the temple that was enlarged and converted during the purging
        * Purging - The time a couple of centuries ago when there was years of drought. The priesthood at the time hoarded food and there were riots against them and their followers.
      * Mainly forgotten now and rarely used
      * Entrance within the roots of the central tree of Meilikki. Pull down the horns of the Unicorn.
* High Priest Aimar Cracan can help get you to the entrance but he is badly injured
