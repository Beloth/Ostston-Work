## Session 1 - 8th Dec 2016

The party met at Wayfair Inn having travelled there separately and not having met previously. The were all sitting down for a meal when the inn was atttacked by a band of tribemen.   

A local patrol attempted to fend the tribesmen off and the party decided to help. They managed to kill several of them but the tribesmen manage to take several female works of the inn captive. Notable actions Slaanesh (Woz) hiding under some bodies  

The innkeeper offered the party a reward if they rescued the captives one of which was his daughter. The party tracked the tribesmen down as they made camp. Slaanesh (Woz) managed to sneak up to the campsite and observed their setup. He then proceeded to run back to the rest of the party alerting the tribesmen to their presense. A fight ensued with Steve's character managing to miss with nearly every cast. 

After finishing off the rest of the tribesmen, the party returned to the inn with the rescued captives. They, minus Slaanesh refused the reward but Slaanesh attempted and failed to sneak it of the innkeeper. As a result he attempted to salvage some of his pride by initiating a drinking game.
