## Session 9 - 30th May 2018

## Description

Having delivered Investigator Dalee to the Library of Ostston the party decided to use the facilities there to discuss the evidence that they had found and to try to decipher the coded messages. After a couple of hours, they managed to work out that A Lord T had withheld guards to allow for raid to occur and that he had warned a Lady A that the investigators were looking into things. Marshal Farlen then approached and the party gave some of what they had found to him but held back some not knowing whether he was a suspect. The Marshal told them to meet him back at the castle the next day, where they could discuss the next move with Arcanist Shaniera.

They then went to Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where they asked Winyfred to have a look at the orb they had taken, however the charge for a magical identification proved too high for them so as a curtesy Winyfred had a quick look but could tell them anything of interest.

The next day the party headed to the castle, where instead of meeting in the Marshal's office they were taken to the Archanist study. Once there they were motioned to be quite while the Archanist cast a spell to dampen any noise, then led them to another room and creating a portal. Stepping though they found themselves in a pocket dimension created by the Archanist, her own Mage's tower where her power was supreme.

They discussed their findings this time leaving nothing out as Marshal Farlen confided in the party that he was worried about a leak and so wished to contain those that know about the investigation to those in the room. They also found the idea of a portal particularly worrying and that could be used to drop an army into the city, bypassing all its defences. It was decided that Shaniera would do an inspection of the city's mystical defences and use that as a cover to try to triangulate the location of the portal. Marshal Farlen in the meantime would look into who Lord T and Lady A are. Possible Lord were discussed, Lord Tanafrey, Lord Terbanis or Lord Torine. The Marshal was leaning towards either Terbanis or Torine as he couldn't see what Tanafrey had to gain. 

The party was told to wait for further instructions so decided to head to the Order of the Anvil to take up a contract. It was a hard decision between killing some bandits or finding and killing an ogre or 2, but they finally agreed on the bandit contract worth 500gp. They tracked them down to a cave system and spotted 6 bandits. They split the party in order to try a pincer manoeuvre but unfortunately their less stealth members gave them away and the bandits were ready for them. In 1 particularly impressive moment Branton charged 1 of the bandits and in 1 swipe of his sword decapitated him. Unfortunately, the party were so focused on the bandits in front of them they failed to spot the 2 who had out flanked them and surprised Yojimbo and Kairon in the rear. The party prevailed however and took the heads of the bandits as proof of fulfilling the contract.
