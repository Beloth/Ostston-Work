## Session 9 - 30th May 2018

## Description

Having delivered Investigator Dalee to the Library of Ostston the party decided to use the facilities there to discuss the evidence that they had found and to try to decipher the coded messages. After a couple of hours, they managed to work out that A Lord T had withheld guards to allow for raid to occur and that he had warned a Lady A that the investigators were looking into things. Marshal Farlen then approached and the party gave some of what they had found to him but held back some not knowing whether he was a suspect. The Marshal told them to meet him back at the castle the next day, where they could discuss the next move with Arcanist Shaniera.

They then went to Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where they asked Winyfred to have a look at the orb they had taken, however the charge for a magical identification proved too high for them so as a curtesy Winyfred had a quick look but could tell them anything of interest.

The next day the party headed to the castle, where instead of meeting in the Marshal's office they were taken to the Archanist study. Once there they were motioned to be quite while the Archanist cast a spell to dampen any noise, then led them to another room and creating a portal. Stepping though they found themselves in a pocket dimension created by the Archanist, her own Mage's tower where her power was supreme.

They discussed their findings this time leaving nothing out as Marshal Farlen confided in the party that he was worried about a leak and so wished to contain those that know about the investigation to those in the room. They also found the idea of a portal particularly worrying and that could be used to drop an army into the city, bypassing all its defences. It was decided that Shaniera would do an inspection of the city's mystical defences and use that as a cover to try to triangulate the location of the portal. Marshal Farlen in the meantime would look into who Lord T and Lady A are. Possible Lord were discussed, Lord Tanafrey, Lord Terbanis or Lord Torine. The Marshal was leaning towards either Terbanis or Torine as he couldn't see what Tanafrey had to gain. 

The party was told to wait for further instructions so decided to head to the Order of the Anvil to take up a contract. It was a hard decision between killing some bandits or finding and killing an ogre or 2, but they finally agreed on the bandit contract worth 500gp. They tracked them down to a cave system and spotted 6 bandits. They split the party in order to try a pincer manoeuvre but unfortunately their less stealth members gave them away and the bandits were ready for them. In 1 particularly impressive moment Branton charged 1 of the bandits and in 1 swipe of his sword decapitated him. Unfortunately, the party were so focused on the bandits in front of them they failed to spot the 2 who had out flanked them and surprised Yojimbo and Kairon in the rear. The party prevailed however and took the heads of the bandits as proof of fulfilling the contract.

## Notes

### Report to High Marsal Farlen and Archanist Shaniera

* When you tell them that the investigators are at the Library, then exchange looks, the Marshal nods at Shaniera and she rushes of to the Library.
* He will personally go an debrief them at the Library after giving them a bit of time to recover.

### Summoned to the High Marshal but not to his office

* You are directed to one of the castle towers. 
  * Archanist Shaniera's office/study.
    * Her hand hovers over a trinket on her desk. Looks like a representation of Mystra the Goddess of magic (Mystra (pronounced: /ˈmɪstrɑː/ MISS-trah), the Mother of all Magic, was a greater deity and the second incarnation of the goddess of magic, sybol 8 pointed star within a circle). She mutters a spell.

        * all noise from the outside stops
      * Motions you to be quite
      * Leads through the office to her personal quarters. 
        * There she lifts a rug to reveal a runic circle
          * Arcana check DC15
            * Some sort of teleportation circle... 
        * Cast a spell and the runes light up and form a shimmering doorway.
          * She steps through and the High Marshal motions for you to follow. He brings up the rear.
          
### Arcahnist Shaneria's Mage Tower

* Stable pocket dimension
* Those who are magically inclined can feel the power, all around pulsing like a heart beat. 
  * Yojimbo - You feel your own power rising, beating in time. Normally you have to actively bring the power to the surface and shape it to your will, at times forcing it but now its also most earger, right at your finger tips like it wants to challenge the power around you.
  * Branton - Tower1 - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
  * Ogden - With the Arcane power surrounding you, you instictively reach for the connection with your god. To your dismay you find it weaker than normal. Its still there but its muted, like you are far from your gods hearing.
  * Kairon - You feel the power surround you, almost suffercatingly so. It beats around you, You get the strange sensation that its almost alive.. and inspecting you, testing you... you try to call on your own magics in readiness to defend yourself if necessary and reaching for the connection to your patron it responds slowly but then the ambient magic as if sensing it almost leaps at the connection smoothering it. Its still there but weak your not sure what would happen should you try to cast anything.
  * Enaris - Tower1 - Eniaris. Your senses, always attuned to nature reach out but where you normally sense the power of nature you fell nothing... Perturbed you feel inward to your own personal store of power and to your relief its still there.
  * Ahsoka - Your ki rising up in response to the power in the air. You feel it beating just blow the surface of your skin, acting almost like a deffense against the magic.
            
* Thanks you for the rescue of the investigators. 
* The Sages have passed on a reward of 200g 
* They need time to recover and find out what happened to Dalee. 
* They are unsure what the orb did/does but has affected her mind. She has gaps in her memory.
* Someone must have betrayed the investigators. Someone from within the guard? The Council or more worrying the Sages of the Arcane?
* Must continue the investigation especially since this portal, if within the city walls could conceivable bring an army in, bypassing the defenses.
* Going to keep the circle of who knows about the investigation to a minimum. Meaning the party, him and Shaniera.
* Shaniera will make a show of inspecting the city's magical defences but will be using that tour as a way of triangulating where the portal site is.
  * Once they know where the portal site is they will call on you.
* Mean while Marshal Falern will investigate who Lord T is.

### Find who is Lord T

There are several Lords with names begining with T. The mostly higly placed is Lord Tanafrey, but there are others. The most suspicious is Lord Terbanis, Alimond Terbanis. He is a relatively recent addition to the Ostston court. His family is rather pominent in Adrana. 

#### Lord Alimond Terbanis

  * Branton make an Int check
    * `>`10 - Terbanis is a powerful family on par with your own. It would be unwise to make accusations without solid proof
    * 10 to 15 - Their powerbase however is around the captial Adrana. They could be trying to grow their infulance eastward. Something your parents would be interested in.
    * 16 to 20 - You remember the name Alimond. He was a notorious rake and gambler, using his family's name to get him out of trouble. In fact just before you left the captial there were rumours of him and the daughter of a Duke....
    
Human male is faint elvish ancestry which can be seen by his slightly pointed ears. Early to mid 20's. Pencil thin moustache and pointed goatee. Expensive clothing and ornate rapier.

He is meant to be in Ostston to make trade agreements but seems more intent on trying to get acquainted with Lady Gellantara. Quiet unseemly really considering she is still in mourning. 

#### Lord Frederick Torine

Late 50's Lord. Greying brown hair. He has been a thorn in the council's side for years, at least politically. He was a close friend of Lord Gellantara but was most put out when Lady Gellantara was name regent upon the Lord's death and has obstructed the council greatly without directly disobeying. Neither the Marshalle or Arcanist can see him involved in something like this.

#### Lord Lional Tanafrey


The childhood sweetheart of a pre-married Lady Gellantara, he was devesated by the marriage between her and Lord Gellantara and much to the chargin of his family left to go adventuring. He became a rather famed fighter adventurer. When his father died he returned to take his place as Lord Tanafrey and a place on the Ostston council. After the death of Lord Gellantara became Lady Gellantara chief advisor.

Currently the advisor to Lady Gellantara, not only because he is a powerful Ostston noble but he was also a childhood friend. In his younger days he was a well known adventurer and still keeps in good shape with regular sparring with his guard. He recently gave use of his guard to the city to help keep the unrest under control
