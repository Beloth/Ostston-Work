## Session 15 - 13th December 2018

When the party made it to the entryway to the temple they found that the water pouring through had submerged the tunnel they used to get in. They also saw a cultist and a couple of devils wading through the water to get to them. They decided to make a quick getaway, downing the remaining water breathing potions. Eniaris in his giant octopus form towed the 2 heavy armour wears to shore while the rest of the party swim for it. Ahsoka made it safely ashore but due to the stress and strain of the previous fights both Kairon and Yojimbo struggled and eventually succumb to the water and slowly downing. Eniaris made a his way back to them, rescuing them from a watery grave.

They then decided to rest at the camp in order to recover, but they were interrupted during the night by 2 hell hounds. Deciding that they weren’t in any fit state to carry on the investigation they decided to head towards Ironhills where they would hopefully meet the reinforcements that Archanist Shanirra had sent. During their rest they did discover that the rod Kairon held was a Rod of the Pact Keeper and the amulet of Meliekki that Eniaris had allowed him to speak to 1 person while in wild shape for 1 hour per short rest.

On a path through the Forest they were confronted by a Female Tiefling holding a bow. She tells them that she has been tasked with hunting them down for disurpting the plans of the master. The party scatter but not before she releases 2 arrows into the party, 1 of which was a hail of thorns. Branton rushes to attack and doesn’t see the rope trap played along the path and is flung into the air suspended from a tree branch, where he remain for the rest of the fight The others move towards the Tiefling but are surprised by 4 dire wolves attack from both sides.

They suffer many wounds, enough to bring Kairon to unconsciousness due to Ogden’s eagerness to cause damage to the Dire wolves. Eventually they defeat the wolves but the Tiefling escaped and continued to harass then party from a distance with arrows and with traps laid in their path. I one particular moment both Branton and Eniaris, who was in his bear form, who were at the front, were trapped in bear traps while the rest of the party were peppered with arrows. 

Finally they made it out the forest and headed to Ironhills.
