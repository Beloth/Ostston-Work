Approaching Ostston the party sees that the guard are inspecting wagons and anyone carrying goods into the city and taxing them. They also notice several merchants bribing the guard to let them through without inspection. Branton takes the WWW chest and heads to the queue. Yojimbo used message to convince Branton that the guard were poor and it would be a charitable case to gift them some gold. Taking the gold the guard waves Branton through without a close inspection of the chest.

They head to Winyfred's Wondrous Wares and Branton presents the chest to Winyfred and tries to convince her that they rescued the chest from bandits. She was slightly disbeleiving especially when Eniaris was unable to describe where they had left the bodies of the merchant and guard. However after getting a old gnome to inspect the chest and found it was untampered with she presents Branton with a reward of 50gp or a discount on goods within the shop. After finding the prices of items, Branton decides to take the gold.

The party then tried to find Major Tharin by asking a patrol of men wearing the boar head crest who informs them that there is no one in their chain of command with that name. After talking to the city guard they find that Tharin would be located at the guard headquarters. They meet with Tharin and attempt to give evidence to he on the corruption of Marshal Waylynn and he possible links to the raids. However during this they also let slip that they were with Lord Greynoot during the hunting trip in which he died. 

Though he is now suspicious of them he decides to present the evidence to the city council. He warns the party that they will be summoned to present what they know and should not leave the city.

The party then splits up. Kairon and Yojimbo head to find a shady tavern to gain information and try to gain the patrons trust by join a dice game. After losing Yojimbo shouts out that they are conmen. This turns the tavern patrons against him and a fight starts. Kairon mainly stays out of it allowing Yojimbo to be overwhelmed and beaten unconscious.  

The rest headed to the Temple of Torn where Branton presented the robes of the cultists to a random cleric asking whether they recognised it. They didn't. He then went to the temple library which as a paladin of Torn only he had access to. Talking to the librarian he is subjected to an hour long lecture  on the nature of devils without gaining any new information. Ahsoka and Ogden got bored of waiting and headed to a book store, where Ahsoka found some books on animal taming which were out of her price range. They also learnt that there is a library within Ostston.

The next day they are summon infront of the city council and while they accept that Waylynn may be corrupt they judge that there isn't enough evidence to link him to the raids. High Marshal Felarn leads the party out of hte council room to another office. There is tells them how the council was split on whether Waylynn was involved in the raids with Lord Tanafrey strongly dismissing their evidence where as he was more open to it because of his trust in Captain Jardon. 

He would like them to act as his agents within the city as at the moment he is light on the number of guardsmen due to the troubles they have been having. However he can't be seen hiring unknown outsiders so he wishes for the party to join the ORder of the Anvil and is willing to provide a letter of introduction to reduce the time and process it would take. The party agreed and with the letter headed to the Order.

They meet with the Mistress of Contracts Roseanne Lemia a felmale Halfing who offers to accept them into the Order if they successfully carry out a contract with a more senior member of the Order. The contacts involved ridding a mausoleum of a prominent Ostston family of some undead creatures who had take up residence there. The party agreed and she reminded them that there should not be any looting of the crypts and that Thorath Ironshield would meet them in the morning.

Entering the mausoleum they find a statue to a goddess with an offering bowl. They leave a small something for luck. At the back of the mausoleum they find that a crypt have been moved aside to reveal stairs leading down. At the base of the stairs lies a body with arrow in his back. Searching the body they found a jewelled dagger and mindful of the warning leave it alone. Exploring further the party comes across a couple of patrols of undead and dispatch them with ease. However Branton fails to avoid a trap infront of a statue and is stuck by a heavy sword.

At one of the larger rooms the party encounters a mummy and while they did defeat it Eniaris was hit badly by its rotting fist and he was cursed with mummy rot. After taking a short rest they head to the final room and halt infront of large, ornately decorated wooden doors.
