## Session 5 - 24th January 2018

## Description

The party continued through the tower's underground section and hears some muttering further down one of the corridoors. They investigate to find a blinded cultists who they attempt to trick into giving them information. Unfortunately, before he gives too much away, they fail and as Brenton gets too close the cultist slashes out with a dagger they hadn't seen.

In the next room they found a central stand which seems to hold a heartstone. Various magic runes adorn the stand and an attempt is made to understand them. They appear to be defensive in nature. They attempt to remove the heartstone but in doing so set of a thunderous trap injuring many of the party. They also find out the the heartstone is a fake.

Further on they find a room where the see a large bearded devil with several cultists and an imp. The imp takes what appear to be a heartstone from the devil before turning invisible. The party withdraw in an attempt to bait their enemies into following them. This doesn't seem to work and as they head back towards the room the cultist instead ambush them. Brenton, tried of waiting charges back into the room and confronts the devil. He is quickly overwhelmed and knocked unconscious. They party rushes to aid him and eventually overcomes the devil but 1 of the cultists managed to flee.

After a lengthy discussion on whether to rest and heal the party follows after the fleeing cultist. They find a small room guarded by more cultists and see inside a robed figure hunched over a runic circle. The cultists manage to hold the party off long enough for the figure to complete whatever he was doing and he turns towards the party summoning a wall of fire to separate them, buring several of the party as well as burning to death the rest of the cultist. The imp and robed figure then enter the runic circle and disappear.

Unable to follow the party rest up and continue towards Ostston. They stop of a night at Wellfair inn where Kairon informs the innkeeper of the fate of his old party. The next day they carry on their journey but come across tracks heading off the road. Following they find a caravan being attacked by bandits. Defeating the bandits they find a wagon baring the mark of a famous store, Winyfred's Wonderous Wares, a magically sealed chest and a manifest. They decide to take the chest to Winyfred's.

At the end of the session they finally see their destination. Ostston.
