## Session 5 - 13th September 2017

## Description

Kairon headed to the bookstore where he was told that the information broker was. As he approached he heard a cry of pain a from inside the store and he rush in. Both Branton and Ogden were trailing he and entered as well. Ashoka you was also told that the information broker may have information for him also entered. Once inside they found the store in disarray. Branton who was distrustful of Kairon the Tiefling accused him of causing it. After a discussion the group decide to head to the back room where they found a dead man and a bleeding out half-elf. Ogden failed to stabilize the half-elf whi sliped into unconsiousness. Ashoka took over and managed to keep the half-elf from dying. After more discussion they head you the stairs that were behind one of the bookcases.

In the room above they across 3 dead bodies, one of which on lying across the desk with a dagger sticking out of him and a female elf standing over the body. Next to her was Yojimbo, a bronze dragonborn. After a brief discussion they are interupted by the opening of a secret enterance and a dwarf appear who takes up a defensive position next the elf who is the Information Broker Talissa. 

After a time Talissa agrees to start looking into the lawyers that Kairon wants information on and that Ogden and Branton have been convinced that they have something to do with the raiders. Initially Talissa wanted to be paid as in her words Information is expensive. However the price was too high for Kairon who offered to pay in deeds. Talissa accepted and the group, now including Yojimbo, heads to the sewers to clear the room where Talissa will be setting up.

After battling through several giant rats and swarms of rats the party make it the room where they scare a giant rat who hides in a whole in the wall. As they search the room the rat seems to ran towards the trap door which Yojimbo was standing next to. Mid may towards the trap door it changes into a wererat and attacks Yojimbo, surprising the rest of the party. After knocking him into unconciousness, the wererat heads to Kairon and proceeds to bite and claw at him. The party recovering from their surprise manage to kill the wererat and start to loot the room. While doing so they hear some footsteps coming from behind a bookcase, which opens to revel the dwarf Grundel and several others. 

He proceeds to tell the party to head back to Talissa who has setup in a warehouse while he finishes setup the room for business. The 1st job seems to be blocking off the way the party got to the room, after they leave that way.

### The Information Broker

#### Outside

You are surprised to find that the building appears to be a bookstore. It appears to be a 2 story corner plot with the store front on the main road and the side having a narrow alley. The front has a large window displaying various books.

##### Side alley 

Dark narrow alley. Wide enough for just 1 person to walk down comfortably, 2 would be a bit of a squeeze. 
  * Investigation DC 25 to spot a false wall.
    * Investigation DC 30 to find the lock
    * Investigation DC 25 to spot the sleeping gas trap
    * Thieves tools check of DC 30 to be able to unlock

#### Ground floor

As you enter you see signs of a struggle which leads to the backroom. There you see a single female half elf slumped, hand holding a chest wound that is bleeding badly, next to a bookcase that has swung outwards at a 45 degree angle. Infront is another body of a human male blood leak out of his cut throat.

Looking past the bookcase you see a flight of stairs leading upwards.

##### Female half elf

* Wearing what you would expect a shopkeeper in a middle class shop would wear. Well made by practical clothes.
* You do notice a dagger by her side that she has obviously dropped to clutch at her wound.
* Still alive but fading fast.
  * Medicine check DC 15 to stablise
  
##### Male human

* Wearing a some sort of uniform.
  * Investigation check
    * DC less than 10 - Underneath the the uniform is leather armour
    * 10-15 - several hidden daggers on him
    * 15+ - on closer inspection the uniform is rather badly made. Good enough to pass a casual glance but wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny. 
* Clutching at this throat with a surprised look on his face  

#### Entering the upstairs room 

* Upon entering the room you see what looks like a office. There is a single body lying across the entrance dressed in a similar fashion to those below. The room is dominated by a large desk across which is another body from which a female elf is withdrawing a dagger from one of its eye sockets. She looks you at you with a feral grin. 

##### Room description

A large office space with many bookcases and filing cabinets along the walls. A single large desk behind which is a largish window with blinds drawn down hiding the room from anyone attempting to look in by allow enough light through. Scattered around the room are books and parchment likely a testament to the fight that must have just taken place. There is another body on the floor in addition to the other 2, lying between the entrance and the desk

"Well what do we have here.... you don't appear to be with them" she nods her head to the bodies, "I don't know you and yet you enter my domain with weapons drawn"

She pushes the body of the desk. You notice that this one is dressed more richly. Probably dressed to look like a minor nobleman, someone who might frequent a bookshop...

"So the question is are you here to attempt to do me harm..." she twirls the dagger in her hand, "or are you here for less disruptive reasons.."

<Wait for players>
 
Before Talissa can answer one of the bookcase swings open and a male dwarf walks through, eyes on a purse he is holding and apparently counting...
 
"Well you were right, there was another 2 coming up the side entrance..." as he finishing that sentance he finally looks up and sees you. He drops the purse and reaches for 2 single bladed axes at his side.

"Peace Grondel... they are apparently here on business and had the unfortunate timing to enter during this attack"

The dwarf... seemingly called Grundel grunts and doesn't take his hands away from his axes. He eyes you suspiciously as he walks to stand next to Talissa.

##### Talissa
* Female elf 
  * Blonde hair in an intricate hairstyle.
  * Has the ageless quality all but the very old elves have
  * Strangely calm for someone who has apparently killed several people
  * Wearing an elegant dress that shimmers in what sunlight gets through the blinds
  
##### Grondel
* Male dwarf
  * Dark brown hair with a short beard.
  * Studded Leather with 2 single bladed axes (hachet like) at his side.
  * Suspicious.
  * Hand never stray far from his axe handles.
  
#### The Job

"Well I can get that information for you but it won't be free. Lets say x for that and y for that..."

"Information is not cheap... but perhaps we can come to another arrangement... rather than paying with coin you can pay with deeds..."

Looking around, "Obviously my current place of business has been compromised by my enemies which means I need to move before they can mount another attack. I have another place in mind. One thats less vulnerable than this. Admittedly also less pleasant than this" She looks around with almost a sad look on her face. "Unfortunately I was not expecting to have to move so it is not in a suitable state. Perhaps you could clear it out for me, as part payment for this information"

"The entrance can be found behind the catsle, it is the old sewer's entrance. Here's a map the show you where to go." Hands you a map.

"Grondel with follow you once he has gather some materials an people to make it secure" 

"Anything you find there is yours to keep"

#### Sewer slog

* 2 encounters

##### Encounter 1 - easy

3 Giant Rats

##### Encounter 2 - medium

2 Swarms of Rats

##### Room

1 WereRat

There is old furniture in the room and a giant rat sleeping. It looks like a slightly larger version of the rats you fought before and appears it has made its nest in the room. 

As you enter you startle it and it wakes up and darts into a nook in the wall.

There is a rickety old desks that would collapse with a strong sneeze. Several broken chairs and a couple of bookcases. What books there were have all been ripped up and the paper used as lining for the nest.

Passive perception 12+
You see the giant rat dart out of the nook and head towards the door.... midmay through it changes direction and leaps at <Character>. Halfway through the leap it transforms into....
