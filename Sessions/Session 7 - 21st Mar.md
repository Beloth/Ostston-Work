## Session 7 - 21st March 2018

## Description

After a brief discussion on whether to take a rest before opening the door to the crypt the party decides to continue. Attempting to unlock the door they notice that the a previous attempt to pick the lock has been made. Thorath, getting bored with the long winded discussion that continued pushed past the group and slapped on a stone next to the door. This opened up a panel on the other side of the door which contained a cut off hand with a strange wooden ring on it. Thorath produces a more sturdy version of the ring and offers it to the party.

Kairon takes the ring and inserts his had into the hole, and twists. Unfortunately while the door does seem to unlock, Kairon's hand is trapped in the hole and he feels a needle piece his skin, paralysing him. Ogden cures him but when his hand is removed from the hole the door re-locks.

They entered the room to find it empty of any creatures but did notice a large dried blood pool near the entrance. There was a large ornate, stone crypt in the centre of the room that contained the skeletal remains of Lady Granrus with her hands pried apart. They realise that it was the jewelled dagger that was missing. Half the party leaves to retrieve it leaving Kairon, Branton and Ahsoka in the crypt. On the way back to the dagger they are attacked by 2 zombies which they dispatch with ease.

Kairon, hugging a wall is the possessed by a blue entity that Ahsoka just manages to spot but not before the possessed Kairon launches an Eldrich Blast at them.

After a short fight where the possessed Kairon injures both Branton and Ahsoka, Branton manages to Turn the Unholy forcing the ghost to flee, releasing Kairon. Unfortunately, before the rest of the party return with the dagger, the ghost returned to possess Ahsoka who proceeded to beat up Branton. Kairon and Branton manages to knock Ahsoka unconscious releasing the ghost whose horrifying visage caused Kairon to become frightened and to age 30years. The rest of the party returned and attacked the ghost driving it off before returning the dagger to the skeleton of Lady Granrus.

This caused the crypt to close and a voice giving permission for the party to take a gift from a hidden room. Enairis solved the puzzle to open the room and Kairon, on behalf of the party, took the Bag of Holding and 1 large Opal. The 1000g was split amongst the party with the left over put in the Bag of Holding as party funds  

The party returns to Ostston and Kairon feels like his natural personality and presense has deserted him. They head to the Order of the Anvil where they are told to return the next day so that Thorath has time to give his report and a decision is made on whether they will be accepted into the Order. 

With their free time, they head to the temple of Torn where Enairis is healed from the curse he received from the Mummy's Rotting Fist and Kairon is de-aged. The clerics also found that the Opal that Kairon had was cursed the cause of his loss of Charisma. However they failed to remove it. They ask that the Opal is left with them so that they could research the curse.

In the mean time Branton and Ahsoka headed to the Library and after a brief tour join.

The next day the party are inducted into the Order of the Anvil and chose the name the "Salamander Six". On the way out they are given a message that someone is waiting for them back at the inn. There, they find High Marshal Felarn and Archanist Shaniera, who congratulate them of becoming members of the Order and give them their 1st mission. 

3 Investigators from the Sages of the Arcane have gone missing. They were in Ostston to investigate odd magical surges in the city that were affecting the old defensive wards that Shaniera has control over due to her position on the council. Their last report was they were trying to get an interview with Lord Weester.

The party head to the inn where the Investigators were staying but as it was a rather pricey place only Yojimbo, Branton and Enairis enter. Yojimbo bribed the Dragonborn bartender for some information and a bar maid offers more if he would follow her out back. After some suggestive dialogue the barmaid gets uncomfortably close to Yojimbo and gives him some information before leaving. 

They decide to head to Lord Webster's house and on the way Yojimbo realises that his purse is missing with most of the gold he had earned missing. In anger he throws his remaining 7 gold away, which Ahsoka scoops up to return to him when he has calmed down.

The party interview Lord Weester and after pressuring him it is revealed that he is being blackmailed and was forced to send the Investigators on a wild goose chase to a warehouse he owns. He did have them followed however and is willing to have the servant that followed them give all the information to the party.
