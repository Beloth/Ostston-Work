## Session 7 - 21st March 2018

## Description

After a brief discussion on whether to take a rest before opening the door to the crypt the party decides to continue. Attempting to unlock the door they notice that the a previous attempt to pick the lock has been made. Thorath, getting bored with the long winded discussion that continued pushed past the group and slapped on a stone next to the door. This opened up a panel on the other side of the door which contained a cut off hand with a stange wooden ring on it. Thorath produces a more sturdy version of the ring and offers it to the party.

Kairon takes the ring and inserts his had into the hole, and twists. Unfortunately while the door does seem to unlock, Kairon's hand is trapped in the hole and he feels a needle piece his skin, paralysing him. Ogden cures him but when his hand is removed from the hole the door re-locks.

They entered the room to find it empty of any creatures but did notice a large dried blood pool near the enterance. There was a large ornate, stone crypt in the centre of the room that contained the skeletal remains of Lady Granrus with her hands pried apart. They realise that it was the jewelled dagger that was missing. Half the party leaves to retrive it leaving Kairon, Branton and Ahsoka in the crypt. On the way back to the dagger they are attacked by 2 zombies which they dispatch with ease.

Kairon, hugging a wall is the possessed by a blue enitity that Ahsoka just manages to spot but not before the possessed Kairon launches an Eldrich Blast at them.

After a short fight where the possessed Kairon injures both Branton and Ahsoka, Branton manages to Turn the Unholy forcing the ghost to flee, releasing Kairon.
