## Session 3 - 18th July 2017

### Summary

After recovering from the ambush the party decided to continue onto the scout rendezvous point. After searching around they find the semi-permanent scout camp. Searching it they find several emergancy stores of dried food and kindling hidden within stone cairn. While the rest of the party decided to leave them be, Slaanesh sneaks some of the food to boost his own stores.  

The next day they follow the most recent trail hoping it was left by the scouts they are looking for. After a while they hear a loud scream of pain for a smal clump of trees. They rush to investigare coming upon the back of what appears to be a bear standing on its hind feet. Before they can act it swipes down, striking a humaniod figure infront of it. Sariel rush forward attacking with her scimitar and drawing the animals attention. As it turns the party sees that it was not a bear but an Owlbear. Kairon fires a blast of eldritch energy but was so surprised by an owls head on the body of a bear that it strikes Sariel in the back instead. The rest of the party then gets involved and manages to defeat it.  

The person rescued turns out to be one of the scouts, a half-elf named Tarion. He thanks the group and explains that he was heading back to Highcastle with information for Captain Jardon but was found by a raiding party. He managed to eventually lose them but not before taking some wounds, which he believed was what attracted the owlbear. He tells the party that they had found a cave which the raiders seem to be using as a forward base, he was sent back while one of the scout remained to keep an eye on the cave and the last one headed towards Hillard Fort which was the direction that several raiders and their captives were headed. He allows the party to copy a crude map that he had drawn of where the cave was. Slaanesh attempted to skin the owlbear and gained several feathers while Kairon took a paw as a trophy

The next day the party decided to follow a trail that the Owlbear had left. It lead them to the cave to appeared to be using as its nest. Gienak investigated the cae and found several more owlbear feathers. The party they decided to head towards the cave with Sariel looking for a trail using the map. Unfortunately she was not very successful and they spent several hours wandering aimlessly until eventually they were attacked by a band of raiders. After defeating them, Sariel once again tried to find the cave. After wandering around for several more hours they finally find it.  

Unfortunately they were not very quiet while approching the cave and several raiders head out to investigate the noise. They engage the party as do 2 archers hiding above the cave. After defeating the melee attackers they party move towards the cave to finish off the archers. As the get closer to the cave a shaman emerges and joins the battle. Wolf moved to attack the shaman but after being blasted back if held by some magical spell. Kairon is also knocked unconcious and Slaanesh attempted to stabilse his friend. He then joins the attack on the shaman. Gienak finishes off the archers and attacks the shaman from above the cave
