## Description

While waiting for Ashoka and Yojimbo to return, Branton was approach by a messanger from the temple of Torn who tolds him that there was a druid waiting for him back at the temple with a message from Captain Jardon. The party headed back to the temple where they find the druid Eniaris who explained that he was willing to help the party in their investigations in order to help convice the guard to send aid to the Druids in Blackpine.

The party heads to their only lead back at the warehouse where they attempt to persuade the merchant guards and then the owner of the warehouse to allow them access. Yojimbo attempts to destract them but setting off a noise at the back of the ware hosue. However this only make a the owner an 2 of the gurads to return to the warehouse with the rest remaining and denying the party access. So the party decides to wonder around the warehouse to see if they can find another way in. They do find a back enterance which is also guarded. 

Thwarted the party headed to a local tavern where they sit down for a meal and a drink. Enaris approched the bar and asked the barkeeper whether any of the warehouse workers were here. One is pointed out to him and Yojimbo decides to approch him while he is dicing with his friends. After a brief discussion he attempts to get the worker drunk by spiking a beer with a more potent spirit. However taking the 1st sip of the drink the worker decides there is something off about the drink and sets it aside. Once the dice game ends the worker, and many more of the partrons of the tavern, leave. By the time the party reaches the exit the worker is indistinguishable from the rest and the party is forced to return to their meal.

Heading back to the warehouse in the dark, Branton attempts to suss out the patrol pattern of the nightwatchman. Ashoka uses that pattern to climb up to the top of the warehouse and peers in via the skylight. The rest of the party attempts to hide from the returning watchmen but fails spectacularly and is spotted. The watchman reaches for his weapon and takes out a whistle while demanding what they are there for. Unfortunately this spooks Kairon who launched a spell at the watchman who blows his whistle attracting more for the guard to their location. Branton manages to defuse the situaton and the party minus Ashoka moves away.
