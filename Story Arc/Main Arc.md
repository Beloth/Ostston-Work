## Main Arc

Malachar wants to take over one of the hell planes. His last attempt failed and he was forced to flee leaving behind his power base. Centuries past and he has slowly been gathering followers. He found out about a dark gods attempt at corrupting a temple of Meliekki. He realised that if he could finish the corruption and become the focal point he could gain the power he needs.

### The Seal in the basement of the temple of Meliekki

* The Seal is being used as a link to the main temple that has been sent to another plane of existance. Lady X can use it in the current form to open a small tear and allow things to pass through although this is risky for living beings. 
* The Ritual being performed above ground is aimed at making this portal permanant as risk free. 

### Return to Ostston

* Ostston is under marshal law but not by the city guard. It looks like Lord Tanafrey';s men have taken over completely. The High Marshal has been relieved of his position pending a full investigation on how a cult could have infiltrated so completely. All high ranking city guard are at best under house arrest or in jail pending questioning. Only those that were posted outside are still doing their jobs but taking orders from Tanafrey. 
* The Marshal is under house arrest at his estate.
* City is subdued.
