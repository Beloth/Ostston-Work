## Main Arc

Malachar wants to take over one of the hell planes. His last attempt failed and he was forced to flee leaving behind his power base. Centuries past and he has slowly been gathering followers. He found out about a dark gods attempt at corrupting a temple of Meliekki. He realised that if he could finish the corruption and become the focal point he could gain the power he needs.
