## The Shadow League

No one is sure whether an organised thieves guild exists in Hestal. Most agree that the criminals are getting more and more organised but whether there is an actual guild is up to debate. Does the organisation stop once you leave the cities and towns or is there a greater degree of cooperation? 
 
Each city and major town as a branch of the Shadow league. Each branch is run by a Shadow leader who answer to the Shadow council based in Adriana. The Shadow council answers to the Grand Shadow who is a mystery  even to them. All members pay dues ranging from 10% to 50% of their take. The lower you are down the run the larger % you pay. Each member is only meant prey in their own area and should they move to a new one make themselves known to the local Shadow leader via a subtle hand gesture announcing to local thieves that a member of another branch is in town. Advancement in the guild is based on the amount brought in, either over time or a particularly big score. Secrecy is the motto of the league. Members are organised into cells so that the capture of 1 person would not expose the whole branch. In particular it wants to avoid the Order of the Anvil whose members are most likely to be hired to root the thieves out.
