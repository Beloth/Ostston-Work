## Sages of the Arcane - Mages Guild

Run by the Headmistress, this mages guild is based in Lakeside, its mission is the gathering, preservation and forwarding of arcane knowledge. Members are expected to share all knowledge with the guild for the betterment of magic. It expects all magic users that don’t derive their power from the Gods or nature to become a member and they are extremely distrustful of those that don’t as rogue magic users are generally the cause of most of the guild problems. The headmistress is one of the few outsiders who have visited the capital of the Elven realm and is always welcome in Iradell. High Elves are often seen visiting the guild’s headquarters in Lakeside.
The guild is also represented in the Adriana (Helonic Sormt) as it sends advisers to the Council of Cities but apart from that it has no other presence in Hestal.
