## Details
Ostston's wealth comes from the mines to the north. Mainly Iron but some copper which is traded with the capital as well as the dwarves. Craftsmen come from all over the kingdom in order to set up their trade in Ostston to be near the raw materials. The smith work is known to be of superior quality.. at least for a human kingdom. The crafting and mining influence of the area has attracted a large number of dwarves from the outpost to the west.

Lady Gellantara rules as regent for her young son Corsys after the recent death of her husband. She is advised by her old family friend Lord Tanafrey, the Steward of Ostston, and the Marshal of Ostston. Unrest with her rule has been growing due to the increase in taxes recently. Rumours of increased raids from the Hill Tribesmen and missing shipments of ore have added to the tension.

Due to the unrest she has been forced to ask Lord Tanafrey to supply some troops to patrol the city while the guard are out dealing with the Tribesmen.
