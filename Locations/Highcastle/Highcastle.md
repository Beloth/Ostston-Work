## Highcastle

The large central keep dominates the skyline as you approach Highcastle. It is surrounded by tall walls and several towers making it a formidable defensive structure. Its defensive position however has been slightly compromised by the sprawling town that has sprung up around it, giving any attacker cover to approach the walls. At attempt to build a stone wall around the town has been started but currently only consists of a single gate keep and several hundred feet of wall
