### Other nobles

#### Lord Weester

Young lord, early 20's. Was being blackmailed into giving false information to the Sages of Arcane investigators. Possibly killed in a house fire after telling the party where they might find the Investigators.

#### Lord Alimond Terbanis
    
Human male is faint elvish ancestry which can be seen by his slightly pointed ears. Early to mid 20's. Pencil thin moustache and pointed goatee. Expensive clothing and ornate rapier.

He is meant to be in Ostston to make trade agreements but seems more intent on trying to get acquainted with Lady Gellantara. Quiet unseemly really considering she is still in mourning. 

Family made him disappear due to an affair with a duke's daughter. He has been banished from the capital.


#### Lord Frederick Torine

Late 50's Lord. Greying brown hair. He has been a thorn in the council's side for years, at least politically. He was a close friend of Lord Gellantara but was most put out when Lady Gellantara was name regent upon the Lord's death and has obstructed the council greatly without directly disobeying. Neither the Marshalle or Arcanist can see him involved in something like this.
