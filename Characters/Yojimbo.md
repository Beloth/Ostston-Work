### Male Bronze Dragonborn Sorcerer

### Background story

*I was part of the thieves guild from my teen years, ever since I got a thrill for stealing from the wealthy and giving it to the other dragon borns who had nothing. I quickly rose from petty theft to more lucartive jobs thanks in part to my sorcerous abilities. Soon I became part of a 3 person cell taking on harder but more fulling jobs. As these jobs took on the rich and powerful I soon learnt to meet out my own form of justice to those who expoilt the poor. This sometime lead to conflict with the guild as it interfered with guild business when dead bodies start appearing* 

*One night we were tasked to retrieve plans that a baron near Highcastle had for the expansion of his estate (which were rumoured to involve the destruction of villages without any compensation). There were three of us who went to the baron’s keep: a burglar (Seymour), a logistics woman (Shiva), and myself. When we got to the keep, our intel enabled us to plan a route where we would effectively go in and out unseen/without drawing attention to ourselves. As we snuck towards the baron’s chambers, the Seymour started entering rooms that we hadn’t detailed - it seems he gambled a lot of his wealth away and owed some bad folk within the guild. As he went in and out of the rooms, he increased the chance of us getting caught. We kept telling him to come back onto the right path, but then Shiva also joined him in looting for no other reason than greed. We hit one room and there was an occupant - it was just a chambermaid. The chambermaid started to shriek, so Shiva grabbed her and with one hand over her mouth, drew her bespoke dagger to stab her. I stop Shiva’s arm mid thrust and grab hold of the dagger. We both struggled with the dagger for a short period of time, but she managed to force the dagger into the maid, with my hand on the blade as well.*

*Horrified, I knocked Shiva out with the base of my dagger and left her on the floor and fled. Seymour registered Shiva being knocked unconscious as I ran out of the door quickly followed, but in our haste we were spotted and the alarm raised. We split up and laid low. By the time I arrived back at the guild, it was in uproar. Apparently the chambermaid had been the guild's inside woman and the leadership did not take kindly to her death. Shiva was quickly silenced by the guild but not before "confessing" that it was me that had bungled the job. Seymour had yet to return.*

*As it was just my word against Shiva's my fate in the guild and my life, hung in the balance as the leadership discussed what to do with me. Finally word came back, I was to hunt down Seymour and bring him back for questioning. I would recieve no "offical" help from the guild and until such time I returned with him I would no longer be considered a member*  

#### Setup

*As you leave the only true home you've know you brush past <insert name>, a good friend of you. She barely acknowledges you, which hurts more that you would have thought, but as she heads deeper into the guild hideout you notice that she has left you a note. You smile, she had always been an expert at slight of hand.*

*Once you clear the thieves highway and way from any prying eyes you take out the note which reads "Talk to Talissa, she owes me a favour and she might be able to get information Seymour for you. Just mention my name" in Thieves Cant. There are also directions to this Talissa.*

*As you approach the building you notice a Tiefling heading towards the same building and as he draws closer you hear a scream of anger and then pain from the alleyway. The Tiefling rushes towards the scream….*
