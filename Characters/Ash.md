On a rare visit back to your home village you were surprised when a sparrow searching you out and then giving you a message from you Arch Druid Delvine.

<Name> we have been attacked and forced to flee. Go to Highcastle and gain aid from the guard. They need to be told that the tribesmen are in league with devils.

You say goodbye to your family and head off to Highcastle and after several days travel you tried to gain an audience with he Marshal of the guard but are denied. You waited for several frustrating hours and were about to start kicking up a fuss when you are lead to an office and introduced to Captain Jardon. You tell him about the message you received and request aid from the guard. 

He explains that he is aware of the tribesmen raids and has committed what he can to guarding from further raids but is hamstrung due to lack of manpower. The fact that you are asking for aid for Blackpine forest is also troublesome as the guard has no jurisdiction outside Hestal.  Not only that you have no evidence to back up you claims of the tribesmen working with devils. 

However there is a group currently investigating the raids on the guards behalf and if you can bring him some proof he may be able to convince the Marshal to send aid. He gives you a letter of introduction to the leader of the group, a Paladin named Branton who is currently staying at the temple of Torn.
