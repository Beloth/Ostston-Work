### Male Dwarf Cleric

### Background

#### Initial setup

*After failing to gain an audience with the High Marshal to whom you were going to offer your aid, you instead head to the Temple of Torm <you could chose Tyr if you want but I have a reason for Torm as that is the God that Ash's character worships>. There you meet Branton Batovian, a human Paladin of Torm. Despite his relatively simplistic nature you get on with him and his love of ale is almost worthy of being dwarven.  After getting to know him for a few days you confide in him your wishes to help with the raids and the fact you were unable to secure a meeting with the High Marshal. He informs you that he has been invite to a feast with the High Marshal at which he was going to asking him for information about the Right Knights of Good (strange name for a holy order by hey, humans are strange) and that he can bring a guest!* 

*Accompanying him to the feast you are dismayed by the bearing of the High Marshal. Now dwarves are known for their love of food and drink but even they don't let themselves fall this far… especially those that have an important military role. Lucky you discern that the true administrator of the guard is Captain Jardon and you attempt to make yourself known to him during the feast.* 

*Fortunately Branton has already meet him and is in the middle of telling a rousing tale of his bravery with ale mug in hand. Not wanting to interrupt you friend you grab yourself a mug, and one for you friend and listen in. Your not exactly sure how but Branton decided that this was an invitation to a drinking game and roped several people into joining you.* 

*During the game you manage to have what you thought was a quiet word with the captain about the raids and he was most receptive to your willingness to help. He informs you of a band of adventures that had been sent out to investigate the raids but who had unfortunately all fallen bar one. Branton overhead this and started boosting how he would be able to stop this raids in no time as a true member of the Right Knights of Good, before passing out.*

*You manage to carry/drag Brandon back to the temple and to his room (opposite your own). The next morning you hear knocking on Branton door which seems to continue for several minutes. You decide to investigate why someone is here so early and as you exit you room you see a rather hung over Branton talking to a guard massager who hands him a note as well as a Letter of Marque (or the land based equivalent), enabling him to investigate the raids on behalf of the guard.*

*It would appear that Captain Jardon was not as drunk as he appeared and decide to use Branton's love of ale to his own advantage. No matter, this works… after all no true cleric of <insert god's name> would allow a friend to face danger alone. The fact that this is what you wanted to do anyway is neither here nor there…*

*The note gives you information of a survivor of the last party sent to investigate, a Tiefling named Kairon.*      

*You approached the Inn that Kairon is staying at and ask the innkeeper to point him out to you just as he is leaving. You decide to follow him rather than approach him directly as you wanted to get a sense of who he is as you don't necessarily trust him due to his devilish heritage…* 

*He moves towards a more affluent part of town when you hear scream of anger and then pain from inside the building that Kairon appears to be heading towards. You notice that he rushes towards the building and you follow behind…*
