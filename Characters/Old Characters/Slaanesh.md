Player Bio:

I grew up in the capitol. I was the son of the most famous street performers in the land, "The elusive Screechers". They were the master and mistress of sleight of hand and hiding in the shadows. Crowds would be bamboozled with their trickery and sleekness, and were infatuated with the dark beauty like deadly nightshade. We weren't a wealthy family at all, but we had enough. We'd travel from borough to borough and people would eagerly anticipate our arrival. During the performances, my parents would tell me to practise my thievery by identifying the cruel and wealthy, and ransacking their pockets. If it ever looked like I was about to get caught, my parents would distract the target to give me a swift escape. I got real good at it by the age of 9, and knew who was good and bad with great ease. I had never been happier; my parents were my idols, and I was fast becoming one of the swiftest hands in the land. 

But that all tumbled down when my parents performed in the fisherman's wharf. There lived an angry and talentless street performer, who was thug-like and bullied the audience into paying him for a shoddy performance. His name was Levi, short for Leviathan. My parents were invited by the captain of the dock to perform, and they put on one of their best shows. The crowd hadn't felt so touched and mesmerized, so the captain invited them to do more shows regularly there. Levi caught wind of this and sabotaged the stage. When my parents were about to do their final trick, he pulled the triggered and the stage collapsed, and he threw a couple of great big hulking anchors on them, taking them to a watery grave. Levi wasn't all that smart, and people knew he killed them, so he fled. 

Since then, I've been living on the streets and have a couple of other friends who practise their slight of hand. We sleep where we can, and take what we need to survive. Throughout this time, I've learned the value of combining my slight of hand with a blade or two, because people don't take too kindly to folk like me. Now that I've gathered enough resources to leave the capitol, I'm on a quest to find Levi, and flay him.
