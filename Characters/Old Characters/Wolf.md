Player Bio

As a new born babe, Wolf was left on the doorstep of the Wizard Tarnis who lived in a village close to Lakeside. Tarnis was a mid-ranking clerk for the Sages of the Arcane working at the University. Wolf was left with a message asking Tarnis to look after him, a piece of what looks like it might be a wolf amlulet arounf his neck (hence his name) and another mysterious parchement with unknown lettering on it. Dispite all mundane and arcane methods employed, Tarnis was never able to discipher the lettering but has kept it safe for Wolf.  

As the adopted son of a Wizard, Wolf was enrolled in the University's school but it was quickly apparent that he had little to no magical ability and was soon the subject to the taunts and bullying of has agemates. What he lack in magically ability he tried to make up with brute strength and his father had to remove him from the school and home tutor him instead. As he grew up he began to develop he martial skills inorder to make his way in the world as he wanted to find out more about his mysterious past.
