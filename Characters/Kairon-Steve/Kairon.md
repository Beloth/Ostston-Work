Player Bio

#### Inital setup

After recovering from the ordeal you spend some time reflecting on what happened to you. It was clear that there was some reason you were not killed out right and that reason had to do with your patron and/or your devilish heritage. You reason that this could be related to the mission your patron had initially sent you out to investigate and that the raids are linked to the rivals power bid. After all what interest would a bunch of tribesman have in a devil otherwise? 

You decide to question Captain Jardon about any information he found out about what happened at Hillard Fort. He tells you how the gatekeeper was taken prisoner and had given some interesting information. That he and several others were hired by the man in the captains uniform, named Delgaron. They were to pretend to be guards on the outer wall and turn all way. He talks about how several small parties of prisoner were taken in and the taken as larger groups towards Blackpine forrest. However the last of the prisoners left only a couple of days ago (Probably over a week ago now).

Captain Jardon also explains the tattoo found on all the slain pretend guards (will show it to you later) and how the gatekeeper did not have such a mark. The men with the tattoos were not tribesmen but seemed to be suppling the tribesmen with weapons, armour and other goods in return for the prisoners.

Not know how to proceed you asking for guidance from you patron and are surprised by the appearance of an imp who quickly gives you the name of an information broker here in Highcastle 

The next day you walk towards the location of this information broker (Talissa) which appears to be a building in a nicer part of town. As you approach the building think of what to ask you hear a scream of anger and then pain from inside the building and you rush to investigateâ€¦.
