### Male Human Paladin

### Background

#### Initial Setup

*After a few days in Highcastle looking for the Right Knights of Good you receive an invitation to a feast from the High Marshal Weylynn. Believing that he would have information about the order you readily accept. On the night however and much to your disappointment, it finally becomes clear that he was actually only interested in your family name and how to get into its good graces. Despite your lack of intellect you become aware of his true nature due to his lack of sophistication in the game in comparison to those at the capital.*

*As the evening continued you turned to drink to hide your disappointment. On drink led to another and another until you finally wake up the next morning back at your inn. You awaken to a loud knocking on your door and when you open it you are faced with a messenger who hands you a note as well as a Letter of Marque (or the land based equivalent), enabling you to investigate the raids on behalf of the guard. You dimly remember upon hearing of the raids the evening before, of boosting infront of the guard captain of how you could solve the issue easily.*  

*The note gives you information of a survivor of the last party sent to investigate, a Tiefling named Kairon.*

*You approached the Inn that Kairon is staying at and ask the innkeeper to point him out to you just as he is leaving. You decide to follow him rather than approach him directly as you wanted to get a sense of who he is as you don't necessarily trust him due to his devilish heritage…* 

*He moves towards a more affluent part of town when you hear scream of anger and then pain from an alleyway next to the building that Kairon appears to be heading towards. You notice that he rushes towards the alleyway and you follow behind…*
