### Talissa's Note to Yojimbo


Yojimbo,

  I have information for you regarding your quarry, Seymour. It would appear that he has been looking to move on to bigger and better things. He has been in contact with at least one of the leaders of the League within Ostston and has been passing on information that may have been damaging to the local leadership. Your altercation with him has moved up his timetable and in turn made him sloppy as he has not only found himself in trouble with the League but also the city guard and as such has had an arrest on sight put on him. This has made him go to ground and look for alternative ways out of the city and a way to get to Ostston undetected. 
  
  He has been seen in the company of a relatively new group to the city, the Cult of Malchar. This cult is very secretive and I don't have much information at this time. They seem to keep mainly to the poorer and business areas of the city. They also appear to have some in with the city guard as patrol routes have been altered away from areas of interest. I can't be sure how far up the chain this goes. It is also rumoured that they have a powerful magic user so watch your back
  
  This ends our agreement and any further information with be charged at the usual rate.
  
  Talissa
