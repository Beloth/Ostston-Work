### Talissa's Note to Yojimbo

Yojimbo,

  I have imformation for you regarding your quarry, Seymour. It appears he had not only found himself in trouble with the League but also the city guard and as such has had an arrest on sight put on him. This has made him go to ground and look for alternative ways out of the city and a way to get to Ostston undetected. It would appear that he had been planning this move for some time and has been in contact with 1 of the leaders of the League in Ostston. Your altercation with him has just push up his timetable.
  
  He has been seen in the company of a relatively new group to the city, the cult of Malchar. I don't have much information at this time on this cult but they seem to have a relatively powerful magic user so watch your back.
  
  This ends our agreement and any further information with be charged at the usual rate.
  
  Talissa
