* Do you actually want to know where your village is from - Your description mentions Highcastle but that is unlikely due to it being very far inland. I do have a place in mind but your description also says you can't remember who you were or where you were from.

* I'm going to tweak (if not out right change) the visions if you don't mind (and let me know if you do). Instead of 2 visions there is only going to be one.

*A dark forboding landscape with darkened sky. You see a forest with a dark visage overhead, long snaking lines move towards the forest. You are propelled forward, closer to the forest, the lines become more distinct, they are lines of people, all shuffling towards the forest. You are moved closer and closer until you can make out more features. To your horror the people are all chained... slaves. You move closer still until you are right next to one, you look up at his face, its the 1st mate of the pirate ship that had captured you. Shocked you don't react as the line continues to move forwards until finally one arrives that you don't have to look up to see its face. In fact its the same height as you.. slowly recognition dawns. Its <insert name> your surviving friend from the village. You try to reach for him but you are pull away by fome unknown force. You scream in rage but that is quickly drown out by the manical laughter coming from the visage over the forest.*

If you are happy with that you can make up how you leave the monastory. E.G. was it with or with out permission, etc
